716. The Crystal Structure of the trans-Dimer of Nitrosoiso- 
butane. 
By HANS DIETRICH AND DOROTHY CROWFOOT HODGKIN. 
The crystal structure of the trans-dimer of nitrosoisobutane has been 
determined by the calculation of the electron density in three projections. 
The molecule is centrosymmetric, the N,O, group is planar, with N-N, 
1.27 f 0-02 A, and N-O, 1-30 f 0.02 A. 
THE molecular structure of dimeric nitroso-compounds is of considerable theoretical 
interest, particularly in relation to the nature of the N-N bond connecting the two mono- 
mers. The discovery that the dimers of certain aliphatic nitroso-compounds can be 
obtained in cis- and trans-forms1 shows that there is no free rotation around the N-N

bond and suggests this bond has considerable double-bond character. Evidence bearing 
on this view has been discussed recently by Gowenlock and Liittke; to this we now add 
X-ray data on the molecular structure of one of the aliphatic nitroso-compounds prepared 
by Gowenlock and Tr~tman,~ the trans-dimer of nitrosoisobutane. 
EXPERIMENTAL 
The crystals of the trans-dimer of nitrosoisobutane are fragile, colourless, transparent mono- 
clinic plates up to 1 mm. in length. The measured unit-cell dimensions are a = 8.84, b = 9-93, 
c = 6.14 A, and p = 96-17", the space group P2,/c; p (calc.) = 0.927, for M = 348; Fooo = 192. 
These figures correspond with the presence of two molecules of the dimer in the unit cell and 
imply that the dimer molecule itself is centrosymmetrical.

[ 19611 Crystal Structure of the trans-Dimer of Nitrosoisobutane. 3687 
All the crystals examined were twinned, (100) being the twinning plane. The intensities 
of the X-ray reflections were recorded on Weissenberg photographs and measured by eye 
estimation, the multiple-film technique being used. Some overlapping of reflections from the 
twin components occurred for reflections other than the hkO series. This overlapping confused 
the intensity measurements of general reflections; it was allowed for in the zones studied by 
the examination of a few crystals where the twin components were noticeably unequal in 
weight; it led to the decision not to study this crystal structure by three-dimensional methods. 
The measured intensities were corrected for the Lorentz and polarisation effects but not for 
absorption or extinction; they were placed on an approximately absolute scale by Wilson's 
method and re-scaled later by comparison with the calculated values. The F values so derived 
for the different zones studied are recorded in Table 1. They are subject to rather different 
errors owing to the irregular shapes of the crystals used. The F2 values were sharpened to 
correspond approximately with those to be expected from atoms at rest before the calculation 
of the Patterson series.

The atomic scattering factors used were those of Berghuis, Haanappel, Potters, hpstra, Macgillavry, and Veenendal, Acfa Cryst., 
1955, 8, 478. 
Structure Analysis.-The x and y co-ordinates of the atomic positions were derived to a 
first approximation from a study of the sharpened Patterson projection along [OOl]. They 
were improved by the calculation of the corresponding electron-density projection and a differ- 
ence map. The agreement factor between calculated and observed structure amplitudes was 
then H = ll.Syo and did not decrease substantially after two further rounds of calculation 
and difference maps; the latest value is 11.1%. The z parameters of the atoms were next 
estimated with the help of stereochemical and packing considerations and refined by the cal- 
culation of the sharpened Patterson projection along [OlO], two Fourier projections, three 
difference maps, and one round of least-squares refinement. The intensity estimations of 
the hOE reflections, on which these calculations were based, were subject to much larger experi- 
mental errors than the hkO reflections owing to the twinning and unfavourable shapes of the 
crystals. 
The arrangement of the atoms in the crystal found through these calculations is shown by 
the projections along [OOl] and [OlO] in Figs. 1 and 2. In both of these projections the oxygen 
atom overlaps C,; as a consequeiice the N-0 and C-N distances could not be precisely measured. 
It was observed, however, that no serious overlapping of atoms should occur in an electron- 
density projection along [ 1011 and measurements were accordingly made of the intensities 
of hkl reflections. After one Fourier projection and one difference map the agreement between 
observed and calculated structure amplitudes for these reflections was R = 8.5% ; it did not 
improve after one more difference map had been calculated. At this stage, R was quite large, 26.5%.

From the refined projections along [OOl] and [loll good values for the x and y parameters 
and much improved values for the z parameters of the atoms could be derived. R for the 
h0Z reflections was reduced to 22.3% and, after a further difference map, to 19.8%. For each 
of the three zones studied, final Fourier projections were calculated, which are shown in Figs. 
1-3. The latest calculated structure amplitudes are recorded with the observed values in 
FIG. 3. EZectvon density pvojection along [loll. 
Table 1 while Table 2 gives the co-ordinates of the atoms and the individual isotropic thermal 
parameters on which these calculated values are based. As might be expected the individual 
atomic thermal parameters vary in the three projections studied; in all, C, and C, show much 
greater temperature vibrations than the other atoms, and their positions are correspondingly 
less well defined.

The parameters of the hydrogen atoms given in Table 2 were derived from stereochemical 
considerations, and their contributions were included in the latest structure-factor calculations. 
The first difference maps calculated during the analysis were based on structure factors derived 
for the heavier a.toms only; in these, peaks occurred in the region of the hydrogen atoms but 
were not well enough defined to be used to place these atoms precisely. 
DISCUSSION 
The interatomic distances and bond angles defined by the parameters of Table 1 for 
the trans-dimer of nitrosoisobutane are shown in Table 3 and Fig. 4. The positions of the 
atoms within the molecule appear to be closely determined by the usual conformational 
rules of preferred bond orientation. The central N,O, group, including the attached 
carbon atonis C, and C1â€™, is exactly planar, as can be seen clearly in Fig. 1.

Both the N-N and N-0 distances have values intermediate between those expected 
for single and double bonds. The N-N bond length lies within the range 1-25-1.28 fi pre- 
dicted by Gowenlock et aZ.4 for the N-N bond in the brans-dimer of nitrosomethane by plot- 
ting the observed N-N bond lengths against the N-N bond order of 1.72-1.93, given by 
FIG. 4. 
C 0 
J. W. Smith.5 Correspondingly, if we use our bond length to estimate the bond order 
for the N-N bond observed in the trans-dimer of nitrosoisobutane we get the value 1.83. 
It would clearly be possible to account for this observation either in terms of resonance 
between structures (I) and (11) in the approximate proportions (I) 83%, (11) (two forms) 
17%, or, as Gowenlock and Luttke prefer, in terms of (I) only with an allowance for 
bond stretching on account of the adjacent formal positive charges on the nitrogen atoms. 
The C-N bond is, as might be expected, a little longer than the value 1-47 A found for 
C-N (neutral) 6 bonds. It is close to the -C-N+H3 distances of 1-50 A and 1.49 A found 
in alanine 7 and threonine.8

The distances also compare well with those recorded by Van Meersche and Germain 
for the brans-dimer of nitrosomethane itself, N-N 1-22, N-C 1.25, N-C 1.57.9 This crystal 
structure, which we have also investigated, is disordered and the standard deviations of 
the bond lengths are so high that the differences between these distances and those found 
in the dimer of nitrosoisobutane are not significant. 
For the crystals used in this study and valuable discussion we are indebted to Dr. B. G.
