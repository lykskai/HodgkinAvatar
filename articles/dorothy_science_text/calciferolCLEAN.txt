947. The Crystal Structure of a Calciferol Derivative. 
By DOROTHY CROWFOOT HODGKIN, BERYL M. RIMMER, J. D. DUNITZ, 
and K. N. TRUEBLOOD. 
The crystal structure of calciferyl4-iodo-5-nitrobenzoate has been solved 
by the heavy-atom method and refined by a least-squares analysis of the 
three-dimensional diffraction data. The unit cell dimensions are a = 31.2, 
b = 6.98, G = 15.3 A, 2 = 4, space group P2,2,2,. The iodine atoms lie 
near special positions and the analysis involves the sorting of forty light- 
atom sites from electron-density distributions which include object and 
mirror-image peaks. Although it has not been possible to fix the atomic 
parameters with high precision (the estimated standard deviation of an 
average bond length is about 0.06 A), the molecular structure and stereo- 
chemistry of calciferol is clearly established. 
THE X-ray investigation of the crystal structure of calciferyl 4-iodo-5-nitrobenzoate  (I), 
referred to in interim reports,l2 has now been completed by least-squares analysis of the 
three-dimensional diffraction data. The general course of this investigation has to be 
 This compound is more correctly named as the 4-iodo-3-nitrobenzoate. However, to avoid con- 
fusion the use of the incorrect name, on which the interim reports 1,s were based, is continued here.

considered within the context of the development of crystal-structure analysis, particularly 
of the steadily increasing power and availability of high-speed electronic computing 
methods, during the past 16 years. When we began our work in 1947, computing 
techniques were in their infancy, and derivation of the structure from a study of the b-axis 
projection alone involved desk-calculations of formidable dimensions. Three-dimensional 
calculations, which now would be done rapidly in initial stages of the analysis, were taken 
up very slowly, at long intervals of time, as computing techniques improved. Several 
of these calculations were pilot experiments, on the results of which other analyses have 
been based. In retrospect it is clear that the most important conclusions of the investig- 
ation were those reached comparatively early. Some features of the stereochemical form 
of the molecule were settled by the initial two-dimensional work, others by the three- 
dimensional electron-density calculations which followed. The refinement of the crystal 
structure still presents problems which have not been completely resolved. The difficulties 
are due to the large number of atoms involved, to the fact that many of them lie near 
special positions in the unit cell, and to imperfections in the intensity data collected in 
1947. If improved intensity measurements can be made in the future it may be worth 
while to continue this analysis and to derive more exact bond lengths and bond angles 
in the calciferol molecule than we can calculate at present. 
The crystals of calciferyl4-iodo-5-nitrobenzoate were prepared by Mrs. Rita Cornforth 
after a search for suitable crystalline heavy-atom derivatives. Experiments by Dr. J. W. 
Cornforth in 1956 checked that no isomerisation of the molecule had occurred during 
esterification. The chemical preparation and characterisation of the crystals are decribed 
in an Appendix to this paper. 
STRUCTURE ANALYSIS 
Crystals of calciferyl 4-iodo-5-nitrobenzoate, C,,H,,INO, (M, 67 1.6), are deep yellow 
orthorhombic prisms, a = 31-2, b = 6.98, c = 15.3 A, 2 = 4, space group P212,21, density 
calc. = 1.36. Our experimental data consisted of the relative F values for 299 h01, 369 hll, 
365 h21, 319 h31, 198 h41, 150 h51, and 77 h61 reflexions (1777 in all). These were derived mostly 
from visual intensity estimates of the corresponding equi-inclination Weissenberg photographs 
made with Cu-K, radiation; the h61 reflexions were estimated from a supplementary set of 
oscillation photographs. Data for individual layers were brought to a common scale by correl- 
ation with an OM Weissenberg photograph; the scale factors derived in this way were later 
adjusted somewhat on the basis of a comparison with calculated F values. 
The x and z parameters of the iodine atoms were obtained from the (010) Patterson projection; 
XI = 0.010; z1 = 0.626. Electron-density projections on (010) then led to the gradual 
recognition of x and z parameters for the remaining carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen atoms and 
eventually to the molecular model described and discussed in our 1948 publication. 
The y parameter of the iodine atom was estimated from the (100) Patterson projection 
(along a 31 A periodicity!) to be about 0-23-0-25. This value was checked by calculating 
the Harker section (4, y, z) which led to yI = 0.24. With x N 0 and y N 0.25, the heavy atoms 
are approximately related by the symmetry operations of the space group Imnza; a first 
electron-density distribution phased on their contributions alone might be expected to show 
the high symmetry of this space group. In the actual first three-dimensional distribution 
pl, calculated at the National Physical Laboratory, this false symmetry was reduced to that 

19631 The Crystal Structure of a Calciferol Derivative.  
of Pcm2,. The reduction was mainly due to the greater effectiveness of the small x para- 
meter in relation to the long a axis in breaking down false symmetry compared with y and 
small b. This effect was enhanced by using the signs calculated for the h0Z terms from the 
refinement of the (010) projection in the evaluation of the three-dimensional series, together 
with phase angles for the iodine contribution alone for the remaining hkl terms. The distribu- 
tion accordingly showed false mirror planes only at y = 4 and at A = 2. Fig. la illustrates 
its character. The atoms each appeared accompanied by its mirror image at peak heights 
varying from 2.5 to 5 e/A3, together with a few spurious peaks of the same magnitude marked, 
probably significantly, by having no mirror image. Generally the two mirror-image peaks 
were almost identical in height; there was a slight bias in the direction chosen; 7 peaks of 
the selected configuration were definitely the stronger as against 3 of the alternative. Eight 
atoms lay very close either to y = 4 or y = 8, and were represented by single, often elongated, 
peaks. In two cases, where bonds crossed the mirror planes nearly at right angles, the object 
pez,k of one atom overlapped the mirror image of its neighbour. In this state of confusion, it 
was fortunate that approximate x and z parameters for most of the atoms were known from 
the projection work. This limited the interpretation of the three-dimensional series to the

choice between two, or occasionally four, alternatives of a y parameter consistent with stereo- 
chemical considerations. In the majority of cases there was no ambiguity; even in the most 
difficult region where the atoms linking ring A to rings c and D lie close to the spurious mirror 
plane, there was definite bias in favour of one stereochemically consistent model. Only for 
the last four atoms were we unable to identify convincing atomic peaks near their expected 
positions (this was partly due to our wrong interpretation of the projection in this region which 
was included in the signs of the h0Z terms). These missing atoms were omitted from the next 
phasing calculations. 
At this stage (1954) it became possible, for the first time, to make use of the high-speed 
computing facilities offered by the SWAC computer in Los Angeles.3 The second three- 
dimensional electron-density distribution, p2, was phased on the assumed positions of all atoms 
in the molecule except the last four of the side-chain. It contained not only the 37 peaks 
corresponding to the atoms included in the structure factor calculation but also 4 additional 
peaks of only 1-2 e/AS corresponding to the atoms that had been omitted. Fig. 1 illustrates 
how the spurious symmetry in pl had virtually disappeared in p2. The new positions found 
for the 4 terminal atoms of the side-chain differed from those inferred from the two-dimensional 
work and corresponded to the opposite stereochemical configuration at C(24) to that suggested 
in the preliminary pub1ication.l The occurrence of 4 peaks in reasonable positions for the 4 
missing atoms and the absence of mirror image peaks for the other atoms was taken as evidence 
that the molecular model that had been selected out of the various possibilities from the 
iodine-phased distributions was the correct one. Accordingly our subsequent work was 
limited to the refinement of this model alone. 
A second set of structure factor calculations 
led us to change the scaling of the various layers of observed F values (October 1957). A 
revised three-dimensional electron-density distribution, p3, was then calculated with the 
re-scaled data (Fig. 2), together with one based on the calculated F values (May 1958). 
Althqugh the peak shapes in both distributions were often distorted their centres were deter- 
mined, as far as possible, by nineteen-point routine calculations and shifts applied from the 
relations between the two series. The atomic positions derived were then used as the starting 
point for a series of least-squares calculations which were carried out on an IBM 7090 computer 
at Los Angeles, but only after an interval of several years (to March 1962) during which the 
problem lay dormant. 
Two separate series of least-squares refinements have been carried out, the first assigning 
anisotropic thermal parameters to the atoms and the second isotropic thermal parameters. 
Although R is rather lower for the first series, 11-9 as against 15.4 for the second, we prefer to The refinement followed a fairly normal course.

record the atomic positions reached by the second procedure. With a structure as complex 
as the present, and imperfect data, the anisotropic refinement seems merely to add degrees 
of freedom which have no physical meaning. 
In the preferred analysis, the 1777 experimental F values were fitted to the 3 positional 
parameters and an individual isotropic temperature factor, B, for each atom, together with an 
overall scale factor. Three cycles were done with partial shifts (0.6 for positions, 0-4 for 
B’s) and then two with full shifts. All the final shifts were smaller than one-third of the 
corresponding estimated standard deviations, except for B of C(21) which shifted by an amount 
equal to 1.4 times its estimated standard deviation. 
Although further improvement in R could certainly now be obtained by re-introducing 
anisotropic thermal parameters it seems unlikely that these would lead to significant improve- 
ment in our knowledge of the structure, apart perhaps from a better description of the iodine 
atom. A difierence map, calculated from the final parameters shows seventeen regions in 
which the electron density deviates from zero by more than &1.0 e/A3. Thirteen of these 
regions are in the neighbourhood of the iodine atom and the remaining four are small negative 
troughs 1 A or more from any atom. None of them can indicate any significant changes in 
the atomic positions. 
In the latest structure- 
factor calculations, the f curve used for iodine was that of Thomas and Umeda,4 and for oxygen, 
nitrogen, and carbon (trigonal and tetrahedral) those of M~Weeny.~ The observed and calculated F values are recorded in Table 1.

The set of atomic parameters obtained from the last least-squares cycle is given in 
Table 2. The estimated standard deviations in the positions of the carbon, nitrogen, and 
oxygen atoms lie mostly in the range 0.034-05 A. Apart from C-I, 1.96 A (e.s.d. 0-03 A), 
the estimated standard deviation (e.s.d.) of an average bond is thus about 0.06 A with a 
corresponding limit of error (95% significance level) of about 0-12 A, In these circum- 
stances, the numerical values that have been derived for the individual bond distances 
from the parameters of Table 2 are of little interest and we do not reproduce or discuss

them here. It would hardly be possible on the basis of these bond distances alone even 
to distinguish double from single bonds with confidence. Nevertheless, the average 
distances for different types of bonds, based on formula (I) are reasonable, although 
associated with large average deviations in keeping with the above accuracy estimates. 
These average values are given in Table 3.

The B values listed in Table 3 are associated with estimated standard deviations of up 
to 1 A2 and hence most of the variations in the thermal parameters among the different 
atoms have little physical meaning; the very high value of B for O(l1') probably only 
reflects the greater uncertainty attached to the placing of this atom which is confused 
by diffraction effects around the iodine atom. 
In spite of the unreliability of individual bond distances and angles, the overall stereo- 
chemical relation of the atoms in the molecule are clear. In Fig. 3 the molecule is shown 
in projection down the b- and c-axes in the correct absolute configuration as defined by 
recent experiments; 697 the stereochemical configurations about the two asymmetric atoms, 
C(20) and C(24), can be described as R and S, respectively, where the secondary carbon 
atom substituents are given priority over the double bond.8 This stereochemical arrange- 
ment about C(24) is the opposite to that proposed in our preliminary work but it was 
already described correctly in our second note and is in agreement with other recent 
stereochemical ~tudies.~ The conformation adopted by the side-chain in the crystal is 
interesting in that the main chain is not in the planar zigzag form, as can be seen from 
Fig. 3. This conformation appears, from consideration of models at least, to be rather 
favourable as far as non-bonded repulsive interactions are concerned. C(26) and C(27) 
are, respectively, antiperiplanar and synclinal with respect to C(28). 
Ring D adopts the conformation with 
the two atoms at the ring junctions on opposite sides of the plane of the other three 
[C(13), + 0-47 A; C(14), - 0-24 A]; ring c is in the chair form and so is ring A. The 
tvans-conjugated diene system, including the atoms C(lO), C(4), C(5), C(6), C(7), C(8), 
C(9), and C(14), is planar to within 0.13 A; however, if one takes the two halves of this 
system separately, the angle between the two planes, about the central C(6)-C(7) bond, 
is 9". The cis-diene system is definitely non-planar; it seems best described in terms of 
two planes, one defined by atoms C(1), C(lO), C(5), and C(19), the other by C(5), C(4), 
C(6), and C(lO), which are at 54" to one another. The angle between the first of these 
planes and the trans-diene system is 52". With this type of arrangement, too close contact 
between hydrogen atoms attached to C(7) and C(19) is avoided. In spite of the irregular 
interatomic distances present, all the atoms of the benzene ring lie within 0-02 A of a single Rings c and D, as expected, are trans-fused.

The molecular packing is of an exceptionally intricate nature, as is evident from Fig. 4, 
and is one to which the unit-cell dimensions give no clue. The shortest intermolecular

Since the 4-iodo-5-nitrobenzoyl group has now been used as a heavy-atom marker in several 
investigations the preparative chemistry employed is reported here. Light petroleum used 
was the fraction of b. p. 60-80". 
4-Iodo-5-nitrobenzoyl chloride. p-Iodobenzoic acid (3.6 g.) was added to a mixture of 
concentrated sulphuric acid (13 ml.), fuming sulphuric acid (4 ml.; 20% SO,), and fuming 
nitric acid (6 ml.; d 1.5). The mixture was warmed on a steam-bath until the solid dissolved

and for & hr. thereafter. To the cooled solution water was added dropwise without further 
cooling. The crystalline 4-iodo-5-nitrobenzoic acid was collected and recrystallised from 
aqueous methanol, forming yellow prisms (3.6 g.), m. p. 210". This acid (3.6 g.) was warmed 
with phosphorus pentachloride (2.8 g.) and benzene (10 ml.) for 4 hr. on a steam-bath. The 
residue after evaporation at low pressure was recrystallised from dried light petroleum, to give 
4-iodo-5-nitrobenzoyl chloride (3.4 g.) as pale yellow prisms, m. p. 40-41.5" (Found: C, 27.3; 
H, 1.2; N, 4.75. C,H,ClINO, requires C, 27.0; H, 1.0; N, 4.5%). When first prepared, this 
substance formed long yellow prismatic needles, m. p. 49-51", from cyclohexane; this form 
was not again encountered. 
Calciferol (326 mg.) and 4-iodo-5-nitrobenzoyl chloride 
(406 mg.) in pyridine (3.2 ml.) were heated at 95" for A few drops of water were added 
and, after a few minutes, ether and more water. The ether was washed with aqueous sodium 
carbonate before and after being washed with dilute sulphuric acid. The residue after evapor- 
ation was freed from ether and water by two evaporations at low pressure of its solution in 
benzene; it was redissolved in benzene-light petroleum (1 : 2) and put on a column of alumina 
(15 g. ; previously washed with methyl formate). Elution with the same solvent mixture gave a 
yellow resin (467 mg.) which crystallised on dissolution in a little acetone and seeding with the 
original specimen (obtained by the same procedure except that chromatography was omitted, the 
product being precipitated from acetone by methanol and recrystallised from acetone). The 
yellow crystals (265 mg.; m. p. 115-117') were recrystallised from acetone with slow cooling, 
to give deep yellow prisms (185 mg.) of calciferyl 4-iodo-5-nitrobenzoate, m. p. 117.5-1 18.5", 
[0(ID2O +79" (c 0-73 in benzene) (Found: C, 62-7; H, 6.8; N, 2.2; I, 18.5. C3,H,,1NO4 requires 
C, 62.6; H, 6.9; N, 2.1; I, 18.9%). The crystallographic identity of this material with the 
original specimen was verified at Oxford. 
The above iodonitrobenzoate (100 mg.) in benzene (2 ml.) was left at 0" for 19 hr. with a 3% 
solution of potassium hydroxide in methanol (8 ml.). Water and ether were added; the ether 
was washed with water, dried (MgSO,), and evaporated at low pressure. The residue on 
recrystallisation from acetone gave calciferol (15 mg.), m. p. 113-115" alone or mixed with 
authentic material. The infrared spectra (in compressed KC1) of the product and of authentic 
calciferol were superimposable. Additional material (24 mg.) of the same m. p. and mixed 
m. p. was obtained from the mother-liquor by crystallisation from 90% methanol. Since the 
conditions of hydrolysis were too mild to effect appreciable thermal isomerisation of pre- 
calciferol lo it follows that the iodonitrobenzoate was indeed a derivative of calciferol. A 
specimen of precalciferol was kindly supplied by Glaxo Laboratories Ltd. When treated with 
iodonitrobenzoyl chloride according to the original procedure it gave only traces of the ester,
