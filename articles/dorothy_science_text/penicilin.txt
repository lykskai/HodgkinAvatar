An intermediate obtained by Lowe and Ramsay in the synthesis of a homopenicillin has been shown by X-ray 
analysis to have a structure including a p-lactam ring fused to a thiomorpholine ring carrying 2.2-dimethyl and 
3-benzyloxycarbonyl substituents. The compound crystallises in the space group P2,lc. with Z = 4 in the unit 
cell of dimensions a = 19-1 60, b = 6.369, c = 19.052 A, p = 11 1.59". The crystal structure was solved from 
diffractometer data by the symbolic addition method and refined to an R value of 5.16% for 2697 independent 
reflections by iterative block-diagonal least-squares procedures. The central six-membered ring exists in a 
distorted chair form and is oriented at 140.8" to the fused p-lactam ring. 
ALTHOUGH X-ray crystallographic measurements were 
used early to find the chemical structures of both 
penicillins and cephalosporins, rather few accurate X-ray 
analyses have been made since in either ~eries.l-~ The 
present study began as an aid to the synthetic experi- 
ments of Lowe and Ramsay to define the structure and 
stereochemistry of the homopenicillins they had ob- 
tained. The particular stereoisomer investigated was 
found not to have the gross structure (I), as at first 
hoped for, but to correspond with structure (11), with

EXPERIMENTAL 
Thin transparent needle-like crystals were supplied by 
Lowe and Ramsay and were recrystallised as larger, acicular 
plates by solution in ether and precipitation with light 
petroleum. The unit-cell dimensions were determined from 
preliminary measurements on oscillation and Weissenberg 
photographs and refined on a Hilger Watts four circle 
diff ractometer.

Intensity data were collected from a crystal 1 mm long 
and ca. 0.40 mm wide on a computer-controlled Hilger and 
Watts four-circle diffractometer fitted with a scintillation 
counter, by use of nickel-filtered copper K, radiation. The 
crystal was mounted with the b* axis parallel to the 9 axis. 
The X-ray intensities were measured using the 0-20 scan, 
in accordance with the ordinate analysis procedure described 
by Watson et aZ.6 A total of 3353 independent reflections 
were measured within the range 28 < 130°, of which 2697 
reflections had integrated intensities > ~(1). The data 
were corrected for Lorentz and polarisation factors and also 
for the crystal-shape factor.6

A 2% listing of interactions was computed Q using all 
reflections with lEhl 2 1.7. The phases of three reflections

The criterion used for accepting any new sign from the

Phases of 267 out of 291 reflections with lEhl 1-7 could 
thus be determined from the starting set. In the course 
of the sign determination, relationships of the type 
C = AB, E = --A, D = --A, A = + and E = +, were 
indicated very strongly. Hence, a three-dimensional 
Fourier map was computed for the sign combination, 
A = +, B = +, C = +, D = -, and E = - using the 
267 E values as coefficients. The position of the sulphur 
atom was clearly indicated in the E map. Identification of 
other atomic sites was, however, not unambiguous, as 
there were nearly 65 peaks which appeared as high as might 
be expected for the lighter atoms in the molecule.* It was 
then decided to repeat the symbolic addition procedure 
using reflections with lEhl 2 1.4 and a lower acceptance 
limit of 99.55% for the probability of any interaction. 
With these modifications, the signs of 472 reflections were 
determined by use of a computer pr~grarnme.~ It was 
noticed that the signs of the 267 reflections used for the 
earlier E map remained exactly the same. In the E map 
computed with 472 reflections, the sulphur atom came up 
at essentially the same position as in the first map and the 
positions of all the non-hydrogen atoms other than those in 
the t-butyl group could clearly be identified. There were 
* It was realised later that, of these 66 peaks, 43 were spurious 
and had heights > the lowest peak height for a non-methyl 
atomic site in the molecule. t Final observed and calculated structure factors and thermal 
parameters are listed in Supplementary Publication No. SUP 
20648 (19 pp., 1 microfiche). For details see Notice to Authors

of the order of that of the lowest peak for a real non-methyl 
atomic site. 
A structure-factor calculation with the 25 atoms located 
from the E map gave R 30.34%. An overall temperature 
factor of 4 Hi2 was used. Two rounds of block-diagonal 
least-squares refinement with individual isotropic tem- 
perature factors reduced R to 23.96%. The carbon atoms 
in the t-butyl group could also be located from an electron- 
density map computed at this stage. The structure was 
further refined to R 16.31% in five more structure-factor 
least-squares cycles. Reflections measuring less than three 
times the respective estimated standard deviations were 
omitted from subsequent calculations and anisotropic 
temperature factors were introduced. Three further SFLS 
cycles brought R to 10.07y0. A difference-Fourier map was 
then synthesised and all the hydrogen atoms except those 
belonging to the t-butyl group (18 out of 27) could be 
located, One more refinement cycle including these 18 
hydrogen atoms reduced R to 5.67%. The remaining 9 
hydrogen atoms could also be located from a new difference- 
Fourier map. Five more cycles of SFLS calculations were 
carried out and the final R was 5.16%. In the foregoing 
calculations, hydrogen atoms were refined isotropically, and 
atomic scattering factors were taken from ref. 10. In the 
final least-squares cycle, the indicated shifts for all but six 
parameters were less than the corresponding standard 
deviations. Six hydrogen atom parameters, however, had 
least-squares shifts lying between o and 20. 
A residual electron-density map was synthesised at the 
end of the refinement and the largest density in both the 
positive and the negative regions was (0.1 e.7 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
The final positional parameters of the atoms are given 
in Table 2. Stereoscopic views of the molecule are 
shown in Figure 1, and the bond lengths and bond 
angles of the non-hydrogen atoms in Figures 2(a) and 
2(b). Those involving the hydrogen atoms are recorded 
in Table 3. The standard deviations of the bond 
lengths and angles were calculated ignoring the off- 
diagonal terms of the inverse matrix and should probably 
be increased by a factor of ca. 1.5. The stereochemical 
form of the molecule is such that the hydrogen atom at 
C(7) is trans to the hydrogen atom at C(6), as had been 
established by n.m.r. spectroscopy,4 and also to that at 
C(3). The configuration of the carbon chains attached 
to the p-lactam ring in this particular isomer is therefore 
unlike that found in the biologically active natural 
compounds. 
Dimensions throughout most of the molecule are much 
as would be expected.ll There is a tendency for bond 
lengths in the t-butyl group and benzene rings to be 
smaller than normal, perhaps due to inaccuracies in 
atom placing associated with the high thermal para- 
meters of end groups in the molecule. Table 4(c) shows 
the planarity of the benzene ring.

The six-membered thiomorpholine ring has a non- 
planar conformation approximating to the chair form of 
cyclohexane [cf. Table 4(a)]. Its geometry is illustrated These may be compared with the angles found in cyclo- 
hexane derivatives which vary between 56 and 58°.12p13 
The bond lengths are normal except for C(5)-C(S), which kk

The p-lactam ring is the one part of the molecule

it is closely planar as shown in Table 4(b) and inclined to 
the mean plane of the thiomorpholine ring at an angle 
of 140.8". The bond C(7)-C(8) appears a little

ance.17 Sweet and Dahl have recently suggested that 
there is a correlation between biological activity and the 
hybridisation state of the ring nitrogen atoms N(1). In 
the five biologically active compounds so far studied at 
all accurately, N(1) is the apex of a pyramid raised 
0-24.4 above the atoms attached to it. In our 
compound, N(l) is in a more nearly planar environment, 
only 0.067 A above the attached atoms, very similar to 
the distance, 0.065 A, found by Sweet and Dahl in the 
inactive A2 cephalosporin derivative they studied. 
However the number of structures so far measured in 
the active and inactive groups is too small for any firm 
statistically significant deduction to be made. 
Figure 4 shows the arrangement of the molecules in the crystal as seen along the [OlO] direction. The 
molecule is essentially linear and lies nearly parallel to 
one of the diagonals of the ac plane, thus accounting for 
the short b axis dimension. Calculation of the inter- 
molecular contact distances showed that none of them is 
significantly shorter than the sum of the van der Waal’s 
radii of the corresponding atoms.

putations and for many useful discussions, and Mrs. S. 
Cutfield for help with the diagrams.
