CRYSTALLOGRAPHY. 
CRYSTALLOGRAPHIC research in the last two years has no longer 
been primarily concerned with structure determination. The main 
types of structure have already been determined, and the more 
complicated structures are found ip general to be variations on 
simpler types or combinations between them. The prevailing 
interest has shifted to the relations between crystal structure and 
physical properties, and to relations and transformations between 
crystal types. Crystal physics more firmly grounded on quantum 
mechanics is widening its scope and becoming increasingly quan- 
titative and precise, whilst crystal chemistry is appearing more 
and more as the basis on which the chemistry-of the future will 
be written. The rational chemistry of metals and ores is a creation 
of structural crystallographic methods ; the chemistry of cellulose 
and other complex polymerides such as the proteins has through 
them made a critical advance. 
The appearance of the first volume of “The Crystalline State,” 
a general survey by W. L. Bragg, has at last provided an 
authoritative, attractive, and simple presentation of the con- 
tribution of structure analysis to the problems of physics, chemistry, 
biology, and technics. This volume is not intended for specialists 
in the field, but should be in the hands of every chemist who wishes 
to do original work on modern lines. 
Ewald’s new edition of “ Die Erforschung des Aufbaues der 
Materie mit Rontgenstralilen ” furnishes a more theoretical approach 
to the problem of crystal analysis : it is particularly valuable for 
its account of X-ray optics. 
The Properties of Cuprous Oxide.-The commercial use of rectifiers 
and photocells based on the remarkable properties of semi-conduct- 
ing crystalline films of cuprous oxide (cuprite) has drawn much 
attention to the electrical and optical behaviour of this substance. 
An excellent review of this field until the end of 1932, with copious 
references, is given by L. 0. Grondah1,l which leads us to conclude 
that the theoretical side of the subject is not as far advanced as the 
practical. 
Cuprous oxide, as a large single crystal, has a slight electrical 
conductivity which appears to depend on the concentration of free

oxygen which it contains.2 When the crystal is illuminated, a, 
photoconductivity appears (inner photoelectric effe~t),~ photo- 
electrons are ejected from the surface (outer photoelectric effect) 
and a potential difference may be set up between different parts of 
the crystal, as if electrons had been carried in the direction of the 
light rays (Dember effect). Photoconductivity is, of course, a 
usual phenomenon with non-conducting crystals (for a general 
review of the subject see F. C. Nix 5, ; the outer photoelectric effect 
is well known in metals, but little work seems to have been done on 
it for less good conductors.6 The measurement of the photocon- 
ductivity is not easy with cuprite, since the normal conductivity 
may mask the effect ; recourse has been made to the use of periodic 
illumination, allowing the periodic current to be separately ampli- 
fied; and to measurements at low temperatures,s at which the 
normal conductivity is small. The technique of R. Schultze with 
very thin films would also seem to be applicable. 
The theoretical pictures of the passage of electrons through feebly - 
conducting substances have been developed by R. H. Powler,lo 
A. H. Wilson,ll R. W. Gurney l2 and others on the basis of quantum 
statistics; and these pictures seem to be accepted as adequate 13 
for the explanation of the inner photoelectric effect with insulating 
crystals. But Wilson’s theory is dismissed by (Mme.) A. Joff6 and 
A. F. Joff6 l4 atEl unable to explain for cuprite either the potential 
distribution in the illuminated crystal or the variation of this 
potential with intensity of light. It has in fact been questioned 
whether, apart from the presence of impurities, semiconductors like 
cuprite have any real existence as such. 
There seems to be some difference of opinion as to what spectral

range is responsible for the photoconductivity of cuprite : thus 
F,. Englehard postulates the excitation of an infra-red absorption 
band, while D. Nasledov and L. Nemenov l5 even ascribe the increase 
of conductivity on illumination of ordinary cuprite to a heating 
effect. Schonwald,' on the other hand, finds definite photoelectric 
maxima at wave-lengths of 0.8, 0.63, and 0.2 8. The simultaneous 
irradiation of a cuprite photocell with different wave-lengths gave 
non-additive effects,16 while R. Deaglio 1' obtained a marked fatigue 
for the Dernber effect after driving a current continuously through 
his crystal for six days. The indefiniteness of these data must surely 
be ascribed to the significant variation of electrical resistance, and 
even of optical absorption, with oxygen content, previously men- 
tioned; it is not the pure crystal lattice which has been the subject 
of the majority of these experiments. A definite alteration of the 
properties of the crystal seems to have taken place after several 
experiments.18 
The Recti$er.-When the cuprous oxide is in the form of a thin 
layer on a basis of metallic copper, additional phenomena make 
their appearance. The rectifier discs of commerce are formed by 
oxidising pure copper sheet at about 1000" until a layer of oxide 
some 0.1 mrn. thick is produced. Different methods of cooling the 
discs lead eventually to different characteristics.l* l9 The super- 
ficial high-resistance layer of cupric oxide is removed mechanically 
or by solution, and contact with the free surface of the cuprous oxide 
is made, e.g., by rubbing it with carbon and pressing against it a 
thin lead disc. Such a rectifying unit has strongly asymmetrical 
properties; thus it may show an electrical resistance per sq. cm. 
with the copper positive, of 10,000 ohms, while with copper negative 
the value may be only a few ohms. Currents of the order of 0.1 
amp. per sq. cm .-more under special conditions-and permissible 
voltages per disc of 10-30 volts allow the construction of cheap and 
reliable rectifiers of very wide application. 
The theoretical explanation of the rectification is in a very con- 
fused state. Though, of course, contact rectification between 
crystals and point contacts (e.g., the familiar wireless " crystal ',) 
has long been known, such rectification has always been very local 
and precarious. The rectification of the copper-cuprous oxide disc 
is definitely located at the interface of the two substances (as we 
have seen, cuprous oxide by itself has no marked asymmetric

properties), and it is the constancy of behaviour of this interface, 
formed, of course, from the mother copper, and protected from all 
contamination, which makes the commercial applications of the 
rectifier possible. Grondahl has well summarised the theoretical 
position at the end of 1932, and since then there do not seem to have 
been any constructive suggestions for the clearing up of the difficul- 
ties. The following is a very compressed summary of his discussion. 
Attempts have been made to ascribe the rectification to thermo- 
electric effects ; to a microscopic " point and plane " structure ; to 
an electrolytic effect due to the presence of a more highly conducting 
substance between the crystals of cuprous oxide; in terms of work 
functions of the two substances; as due toethe existence of a high- 
resistance thin film, deficient in electrons, between oxide and 
copper ; as due to a cold electron emission into a thin space, largely 
separating oxide and copper; and in terms of the diffusion of 
electrons from copper into oxide, producing a " hump " of negative 
charge whose shape will vary with the direction of the applied 
potential between oxide and copper. Of these explanations, some 
seem to have no valid arguments in their favour, while none is able 
to explain completely the experimental facts. 
The Photoelectric Cell.-Comparatively recently it was found that 
these rectifier discs, if illuminated, generated a potential difference 
between the electrodes.20 The earlier experiments were made with 
arrangements where the light struck only the edge of the discs; 
later, more efficient cells were made in which the light reached the 
oxide layer through a semi-transparent coating, e.g., of sputtered 
gold, which also served as the electrode, thus allowing use to be 
made of the whole sensitive surface. (Similar cells are now being 
made commercially in which selenium, rather than cuprous oxide, 
is the sensitive element.) Considerable electrical outputs are obtain- 
able from such cells; thus E. D. Wilson 21 obtains one watt per 
sq. m. of active surface. The technique of the use and amplification 
of these photocurrents is very different from that appropriate to the 
usual vacuum or gas-filled photoelectric cell, owing to the much 
lower internal resistance of the source. 
The properties of these cells have been widely investigated, though 
attempts to explain their action have not been completely successful 
-as one might expect, in view of the probably intimate relation 
between the rectifier and the photoelectric action. The emission of 
electrons is supposed to take place at the boundary between oxide 
and copper, where a " blocking layer " or " Sperrschicht " has been

located by W. Schottky22 and his followers. Such cells are called 
(( back-wall ” cells (“ Hinterwand ”). But in certain circumstances 
the photoeffect must be located at the “ front wall I’ (Vorderwand) of 
the cell, Le., the boundary between the oxide and the upper (trans- 
parent) electrode ; and in these cases the direction of flow of current 
through the cell is reversed. The assumption of a blocking-layer 
possessing unilateral transparency to electrons, and the transference 
of this layer from one side to the other of the oxide layer, according 
to the observed direction of flow of the current, certainly seems to 
be rather arbitrary. Dember thinks the blocking-layer (which is 
essentially regarded as a characteristic of the oxidemetal junction) 
to be an unnecessary assumption, in view of the photoelectric 
potential difference which he obtains in pure cuprous oxide crystals, 
as we have described; and the criticisms of E. Perucca and R. 
Deaglio 23 support this view. Bulian,ls in a very interesting paper, 
comes to the same conclusion; he shows that the same photocell 
may exhibit a reversal of E.M.F. as its temperature is altered, or if 
the thickness, i.e., the transparency, of the upper layer is changed. 
The significance seems to lie in the optical properties of the oxide 
layer ; light for which the oxide is transparent (say 1>04 p) exhibits 
the back-wall effect, while light to which it is more opaque gives the 
front-wall effect. The thickness of oxide, nature of the upper 
electrode, and colour of the light will decide for any particular cell 
which of these tendencies has the upper hand. Very similar are the 
conclusions of H. H. Poale and W. R. G. AtkinsYz4 who explored the 
sensitive surface of a photocell with a small patch of light of wave- 
length about 0.61 v; they found that the direction of current flow 
varied as the patch was moved from one point to another, and 
ascribed this effect to the varying opacity of the film. 
Therml Expansion of Crystal Lattices.-Before the advent of 
X-rays, (‘ coefficient of expansion ” referred only to the behaviour 
of the massive substance. The question has been reoently raised 
whether this coefficient, measured by macroscopic methods, ought 
necessarily to agree with the expansion deduced from the spacing 
of the lattice, measured by X-rays. If there is a difference, what is 
its significance? For a crystal to give a sharp X-ray reflexion, its 
lattice must be perfect over many thousands of elementary periods ; 
but it is unlikely that this perfection is strictly maintained over the 
whole of any crystal of experimental size without occasional dis- 
locations. Elsewhere in this Report reference is made to the mass

of evidence concerning the " secondary structure " of crystals; 
arguing on the basis of this assumed structure, F. Zwicky25 pre- 
dicted that a difference between these two expansions should exist. 
A difference has, in fact, been reported by A. Goetz and R. C. 
Hergenrother 26 with single bismuth crystals. These workers claim 
to have shown that along the trigonal axis the X-ray expansion 
coefficient increased with temperature up to the melting point, but 
the coefficient measured optically (i.e., by using interference fringes 
to measure the small displacements) remained constant till near the 
melting point, after which it decreased rapidly. They also found 
that the X-ray coefficients do obey Gruneisen's law,27 whereas the 
optically determined ones did not. (Gruneisen's law requires an 
approximate proportionality between expansion coefficient and 
specific heat.) The discontinuities in the properties of bismuth 
which other workers have found at 75" and near the melting point 
were not detectable on the X-ray expansion coefficient curve. As 
an explanation it was suggested that an amorphous component 
coexists with the lattice, which increases relatively to the lattice 
with increasing temperature. On the other hand, A. H. Jay28 
finds no difference between the coefficients measured optically and 
by X-rays for silver and for quartz over a temperature range of 
18" to 730".* 
The X-ray expansions of several hydroxides, those of magnesium, 
calcium, and aluminium, all layer structures, have been measured by 
(Miss) H. D. Megaw,as who finds a general anisotropy, the expansions 
perpendicular to the layer over a range 0-100" being greater than 
those parallel to the layer. In general, the measurement of lattice 
expansions in various directions should lead to results of significance. 
Thus J. B. Austin and R. H. H. Pcarce 30 showed for crystals of 
sodium nitrate that the gradual transition occurring between 150" 
and 278" is marked along the c-axis, but not detectable dong the 
a-axis. This transition they interpret as a separation of nitrate

layers corresponding to a change of thk vibrational energy of the 
nitrate ion to the rotational state. R. Becker and E. Orowan 31 
find that the expansion of a single zinc crystal is not smooth, but 
exhibits several jumps, whose steepness increases rapidly with rise 
of temperature. A. Miiller 32 investigated the expansion coefficients 
of a series of long-chain compounds from liquid-air to melting-point 
temperatures, and found marked differences between the coefficients 
measured along the three crystal axes. 
Melting-point Phenorn,em.-The measurement of thermal expan- 
sions leads naturally to the drastic changes in the lattice which occur 
at the melting point, There is considerable evidence, of interest on 
the one hand to the study of liquid structure in general and on the 
other to the problems of nuclear formation and crystal growth, that 
immediately above the melting point a great deal of molecular 
orientation persists. This is shown by the experiments of A. 
Goetz33 on the growth of single bismuth crystals, also by W. L. 
Webster,34 who investigated the persistence of nuclei above the 
melting point for several metals, including bismuth. The nuclei 
showed time-temperature hysteresis effects and exhibited great 
differences in stability. It has also been found that crystals of 
erythritol, held for several minutes 1" or 2" above the melting point, 
will recrystallise into single crystals with approximately the same 
orientation as that of the original cry~tal.~S The stability of 
crystalline nuclei in superheated melts has been considered from 
the kinetic standpoint by R. Bloch, T. Brings, and W. K~hn,3~ and 
it is shown that they may be expected to melt more slowly, though 
thermodynamically they are at least as unstable as large crystals at 
the same temperature. 
Recent evidence as to the precise temperature range over which 
melting-point or transition phenomena occur is rather scanty, 
W. L. Webster3' showed that for bismuth the temperatures of 
emission of latent heat, of acquisition of rigidity, and of anomalous 
diamagnetic susceptibility all coincided within the experimental 
error of 0-3". A. Miiller 32 found remarkable changes in the lattices 
of the long-chain hydrocarbons " within a few tent,hs of a degree." 
The melting point of substances in a state of fine subdivision is 
known to be lower 38 (often as much as 10") than that of the normal

substance; but this effect is usually ascribed to some form of 
contamination .39 
We may mention the work of P. A. Thiessen and E. Ehrlich,4O 
who observed the structure of the crystalline sodium salts of the 
long-chain fatty acids. The melting points of these acids are below 
those of their salts; and in each case as the salt was taken through 
the temperature at which the corresponding acid melted, it was 
found that the cooling curve showed a discontinuity and the expan- 
sion coefficient a sudden change. 
Lattice Theory.-A very interesting paper by H. S. Taylor, 
H. Eyring, and A. Sherman41 attempts to trace the growth of a crystal 
lattice from the vapour phase, ie., single atoms, applying the 
perturbation methods of quantum mechanics to the calculation of 
the energies of various possible configurations. The calculations 
are applied chiefly to sodium, and the binding energies, as afunction 
of distance apart in various configurations, are evaluated for from 
two to eight sodium atoms. Prom the curves, the most probable 
process of growth of the lattice may be followed; a square having 
once been formed, the fifth atom will be added at another corner of 
the cube, the sixth will go to the body-centre position (where it has 
a considerable stabilising influence), and remaining atoms will 
complete the cube corners. Although these are the most probable 
configurations, definite amounts of energy are required for their 
consummation ; the process of building up the lattice is difficult 
rather than easy, and we may expect finely divided particles and 
surfaces at which crystallisation is taking place to be abnormally 
active-as, of course, we know to be the case. The elementary 
cube which this calculation indicates has a unit edge of 3.4 A. as 
against 4.3 A. for massive sodium. 
M. Born, J. E. Mayer, and L. Helmholtz 42, 43 have improved the 
general lattice theory by three variations of the energy content. 
The repulsion potential is expressed as an exponential term where 
before it was given as a power term. Van der Waals's cohesion 
force is also introduced into the calculation. This theory has been 
applied to the empirical data for the alkali halides. A very simple 
relation between lattice energies and ionic radii and valency has 
been discovered by A. F. KapustinskiM and applied by him and

B. Veselovski45 to about 100 substances. If the lattice energy be 
plotted against l/(rK + rA) where rK, T, are the radii of kation and 
anion respectively, then for these substances the points lie close to 
a straight line, so that the maximum divergence of the lattice energy 
from that corresponding to the straight line is about 10%. The 
validity of this formula makes approximate calculations very simple. 
Compressibility of Crystals.-The most direct way of investigating 
the bonds between the atoms of a crystal lattice is, of course, to alter 
the distance between them by externally applied forces; but to 
make any perceptible effect, these forces must be very great. The 
masterly technique of P. W. Bridgman 46 has rendered possible 
accurate measurements at pressures as high as 12,000 kg./sq. cm.; 
a full description of the methods and precautions necessary for such 
work is given in his book. 
If we attempt to form the equation €or the potential energy in 
terms of position of an atom in a lattice-considering, e.g., an ionic 
lattice of the alkali halide type-then the attractive term is usually 
ascribed to the electrostatic (Coulomb) forces of the oppositely 
charged ions, so that its form is known. E. Madelung4' has 
calculated the potential energy due to this attractive force for 
various types of lattice. We are, however, in ignorance of the form 
of the repulsive term necessary to give stability to the lattice; all 
that we can say is that it vanishes at great distances and is very 
large at small ones. The measured lattice spacing, of course, 
represents the position of equilibrium between these two forces, 
It is usual to express this repulsive term as a convergent infinite 
series and to determine the coefficients of the separate terms directly 
by comparison with the measured compressibilities (for if the 
potential function is known the theoretical compressibility can be 
written down immediately). This has been done, e.g., by J. C. 
Slater,48 whose work also confirms our assumption above that the 
attractive forces are purely electrostatic in nature. But the scope 
of the measurements, even over the largest possible range, is not 
sufficient to determine more than the first two coefficients in the 
expansion, so that extrapolation of the potential function beyond 
the experimental range becomes very hazardous. Several attempts 43 
have been made to suggest forms of function which on theoretical 
grounds would permit of this extrapolation with more confidence.

special reference to the relation of the dielectric constant to the 
crystallographic direction. The work falls into two parts according 
as the crystals do or do not contain orientable permanent dipoles. 
The alkali and alkaline-earth halides illustrate the rule that the 
portion of the dielectric constant which may be attributed to relative 
displacement of the ions of opposite electric signs decreases with 
increasing size of anion for a given kation and also decreases with 
increasing size of kation for a given anion. The nitrates of lead, 
calcium, strontium, and barium follow the same rule, the case of lead, 
which has the same ionic radius as barium, showing the increase of 
ionic polarisation with increase of atomic number. The fluorides 
of iron, cobalt, and nickel have ionic polarisations which increase in 
this order, corresponding to the decrease in ionic size. The remark- 
able case of rutile and anatase, for which the dielectric constants are 
114.0 and 48.0 respectively, has not received adequate explanation. 
The orthorhombic sulphates of strontium, barium, and lead show 
an unexpectedly high value of the dielectric constant along the 
b-axis. As for the nitrates, the ionic polarisation for the lead salt is 
much greater than for the barium and the strontium salt. The 
rhombohedra1 carbonates show the greatest ionic polarisation along 
the trigonal axis, whilst for the rhombic carbonates the differences 
along the crystallographic axes are much less marked. The platino- 
cyanides of calcium, strontium, and barium show in each case the 
greatest dielectric constant perpendicular to the principal cleavage. 
Although they contain water of crystallisation, they do not shorn 
the dispersion with frequency characteristic of ice. The magnesium 
salt, containing seven instead of five molecules of water of crystallis- 
ation, does show this anomalous dispersion for the direction per- 
pendicular to the good cleavage (001). Thus two molecules of water 
of crystallisation are differentiated from the others and are orientable 
when the field is applied in a particular direction. 
The investigation of the crystals containing permanent dipoles 
which may be oriented in the electric field has given results which 
suggest important applications in problems of crystal structure. As 
mentioned above, salts containing water of crystallisation sometimes 
show a dispersion of the dielectric constant both with frequency 4nd 
with temperature similar to that observed in ice. It occurs in

loosely bound water of crystallisation. Thus in gypsum and in 
most alums 52 there is no such anomalous dispersion. Rochelle salt 
has been extensively studied in connexion with its piezo-electric 
and dielectric characters. Errera has extended the frequency range 
of the investigation and found the same great increase in the di- 
electric constant at a particular frequency and over a restricted 
temperature interval of - 10" to -+ 25". The maximum dielectric 
constant recorded is 1300 for a field strength of 200 volts/cm. The 
electrical properties of mixed crystals from sodium potassium 
tartrate 533 j4 have also been studied. The application of X-ray 
diffraction to the study of the displacement of the ions in Rochelle 
salt 55 in an electric field marks an important advance. Another 
phenomenon50 which may be inportant in the study of liquid 
crystals is the anomalous rapid rise in the dielectric constant of 
acetic acid and of p-azoxyanisole just at the moment of crystallis- 
ation. It occurs only for low frequencies. The tentative explana- 
tion put forward by the discoverer is that just on solidifying the 
liquid condenses into a large number of polar groups which in a 
field of low frequency can orientate themselves. 
Electrical Byeakdown in Crystals.-During the past three years a 
systematic study of the phenomena accompanying electrical break- 
down in crystals has been made. To cause the discharge to pass 
through the crystal it is necessary to overcome the tendency of the 
discharge to pass round the edges of the specimen. This has been 
done by (Miss) L. Inge and A. Walther,56 who used a point electrode 
resting on the crystal which in turn rested on a large plate. Under 
normal conditions of discharge, of duration greater than 10-7 sec., 
the crystal is destroyed, but by using special electrical circuits these 
authors were able to apply the potential for so short a time that the 
discharge did not strike right through the crystal. A. von Hippel 57 
also succeeded in avoiding spurious effects by placing the crystal 
between two slightly rounded electrodes, filling the space between 
crystal and electrodes with specially prepared bees-wax, and mount - 
ing this apparatus in nitrogen at a pressure of about 100 atmospheres. 
The results obtained by the two methods are not always the same. 
For instance, for rock salt, Inge and Walther find that the discharge 
passes from the pointed electrode along [lll] directions in the 
crystal, whereas Hippel finds that first [110) and then [ill] are the

favoured directions. In the latter experiments the discharge 
always branches from the anode, whereas in Inge and Walther’s 
work the branches grow from the point in each case, but much better 
when it is positive than when it is negative. The difference between 
these results is presumably due to the fact that in Hippel’s apparatus 
the discharge begins in a fairly uniform field and only after the track 
has penetrated a certain distance into the crystal does the gradient 
at its end become very steep. In Inge and Walther’s method the 
gradient at the beginning of the discharge, being that around the 
point, is very steep. For barytes, the favoured directions for the 
discharge are approximately [loo], [loll and [Oll] ; in calcite, two 
of the [ 1111 directions (which correspond to [ 11 11 in sodium chloride) ; 
in fluorite [loo] and 111111 occur according as the plates are cut 
parallel to (1 11) or (100) ; in beryl the discharge tracks run parallel 
to the hexad axis-a direction in which there are “ holes ” in the 
structure. Hippel has investigated the variation of the strength of 
the breakdown field in the alkali halide series and finds, after making 
allowance for small differences for different crystallographic direc- 
tions, values which range from >2.0 x lo6 volts per cm. for lithium 
fluoride to 0.50 x lo6 volts per cm. for rubidium iodide. Parallel 
with this decrease in the breakdown field goes a change in the 
appearance of the tracks. For lithium fluoride they are sharp but 
become more diffuse as the ionic radii increase. Experiments on 
magnesium oxide indicate that the exchange of a doubly for a singly 
charged ion in the same structural type leads to a great increase 
in dielectric strength. Considerable difference of opinion existed 
between the investigators as to the mode of origin of the tracks, 
whether by acceleration of positive ions or of electrons. The total 
evidence appears to favour Hippel’s view that the phenomenon is 
primarily due to electrons, accelerated towards the anode, acquiring 
sufficient energy to ionise by collision. The track of the electrons 
becomes conducting, and as it advances towards the cathode the 
potential gradient at its advancing end increases. Plastic deform- 
ation increases the dielectric strength, which would not be expected 
if ions were the conductors, since the cracks introduced by the 
deformation would provide easier paths for the ions than exist in the 
undeformed crystal. Other difficulties in accounting for the facts 
by an ionic discharge are that the time of the discharge is shorter 
than would be expected in this case, and that the breakdown 
potential is independent of the previous ion current. Hippel 
supposes that a slow-moving electron makes collisions with the 
atoms and loses energy to them in thermal agitation. As the 
velocity of the electron is increased, it will lose more energy per 
impact, corresponding to the greeter number of acoustic, thermal, 
and infra-red characteristic frequencies to which it may lose energy.

If it has energy greater than the characteristic frequency of the 
lattice, i.e., the “ reststrahlen ” frequency, it will begin to accumulate 
energy and bring about the discharge. This is borne out by the 
constancy (within 12%) for all the alkali halides of the ratio of the 
energy acquired by an electron in falling in the breakdown field 
through a length equal to the side of the unit cell to the quantum 
associated with the “ reststrahlen ” frequency. The correlation 
of the direction of the breakdown paths with the crystal structure 
is not yet clear, but it has been suggested with a certain amount of 
experimental justification that the discharge occurs in directions in 
which there are rows of neighbouring ions having the same sign of 
charge. 
The Elastic and Plustic Properties of Crystals.-Elasticity. Several 
new methods of determining elastic moduli have been intro- 
d~ced.6~6~ In one of thesess H-shaped rnasscs were attached to 
the ends of the rod under test, which was supported by a long 
thin bifilar suspension. The outer limbs of the upper H were 
bar-magnets each of which was surrounded by coils of many turns 
in which currents were induced by the vibration of the magnets. 
These induced currents were amplified and the frequency was 
compared with a known frequency impressed on the same circuit. 
The bar was set into oscillation by a blow with a small hammer 
imparted to the end of one of the magnets. This mode of producing 
oscillation gave rise to both torsional and flexural vibrations, but 
these could be distinguished by observation of the sum and difference 
of the currents induced in the two coils. The elastic moduli were 
calculated from the vibration frequency and the dimensions of the 
rod. Another apparatus 59 for determining elastic moduli con- 
sisted of two identical gravity pendulums suspended from the top 
of the test plate which was clamped at the bottom. When one 
pendulum was started, the slight movement of its support caused 
the other pendulum to begin swinging. This process continued until 
the first had stopped swinging, its energy having been transferred 
to the second. The time between two successive stoppages of the 
same pendulum, together with the relevant dimensions of tho 
apparatus, were sufficient data for calculating Young’s modulus for 
the crystal plate. By using torsional instead of gravity pendulums, 
the rigidity modulus was found. The method devised originally 
by Quirnby 62 has been adapted to measurements of elastic moduli

by Za~harias.~~ A composite bar consisting of quartz cemented to 
the end of the bar under test was suspended by threads so as to 
vibrate freely. The quartz had been cut so that it could be set into 
longitudinal vibration on applying an alternating potential to its 
side faces. To find the unknown modulus for the crystal, it was 
necessary to know the frequency for which resonance occurred 
between the vibrations of the composite rod and the electrical 
circuit, the dimensions of the quartz and crystal, and the elastic 
constants of the quartz. Recent determinations of elastic constants 
include those of 65 quartz,66, 67 gold-silver,68 alumin- 
ium,69 nickel,63 and Rochelle salt.61 The dynamical 
methods of determining the elastic moduli depend on the theory of 
torsional and flexural vibrations of a monocrystalline rod. This 
has been worked out by E. Goens,'l using the fundamental work of 
Voigt. Although primarily concerned with piezo-electric characters, 
the book by P. Vigoureux 72 gives an excellent pfesentation of the 
theory and data of the elastic properties of quartz. 
Plasticity. Much has been written on the plastic deformation 
of metals, but it would not be profitable to attempt a review of this 
subject here. Among non-metallic substances, roclr-salt has been 
most studied. Whilst there is good reason for investigating this 
substance on account of its simple crystal structure and the developed 
state of its lattice theory, yet generalisations are dangerous until the 
corresponding data are available for more substances. The experi- 
ments on the increase of the tensile strength of rock-salt on wetting, 
described originally by JoffB, have called forth many investig- 
ation~.'~-*~ Some of the results oE these have verified the increase

of tensile strength caused by ~etting.~*-'~ A rotation of some 
portions of the crystal relative to others through angles up to 30" 
is observed in the wet salt but not in the dr~.~6 The distortion of 
the lattice makes it monoclinic near the surfaces along which gliding 
occurs.73, 76 The crystals show a considerable increase in strength 
after previous plastic deformation, but this author finds that the 
elastic limit of previously undeformed and uniformly dissolved 
cleavage rods of rock-salt agrees within the error limit with that of 
dry natural crystals.81 Measurement of the hardness of rock-salt 
by the damping method with the Kusnetzov pendulum 83 shows no 
difference in hardness between the dry and the previously wetted 
rock-salt. Further, the elastic limit of the rock-salt in water, 
determined in polarised light, is the same as that of the dry salt. 
Investigations on dry rock-salt have been summarised by A. 
Smeka1.84 He concludes that the purest crystal prepared under the 
best conditions still has inhomogeneities which are responsible for 
the difference between the characters, in particular the breaking 
strength, of the actual and the theoretically ideal crystals. On 
applying stress to the crystal, glide planes develop from these 
inhomogeneities as soon as the stress exceeds the breaking or shear- 
ing stress for the ideal crystal. The crystal is no longer single but 
polycrystalline, and further deformation merely alters the number 
and mutual orientation of the individual grains. At a temperature 
somewhat below the melting point and for extensive deformation 
the polycrystal reaches a breaking strength close to that of the 
theoretical crystal, a fact which is explained as being due to the great 
disarrangement of the grains which prevents any further gliding, so 
that the real strength of the crystal is observed. The justification 
for this theory is based on extensive experiments. The strength of 
the pure crystal (99.995% pure) has been found at temperatures 
from 1.2" K. up to the melting point.85-88 The strength is constant 
up to - 190°, decreases to + 40", and then increases until near the 
melting point. The effect of known amounts of impurities has also 
been 893 The complications arising from the 
plasticity have been almost overcome by working at low tempera- 
tures. The influence of impurities may be seen from the following 
example.s6 Rock-salt containing 0.045% of strontium chloride has, 
at room temperature, a tensile strength of 1000 g./mm.2 as compared

with 213 g./mm.2 for the pure substance. The increase of strength 
caused by the impurity decreases as the temperature is lowered, 
until at - 110" it is zero. On still further lowering of temperature, 
the impurity weakens the crystal until at - 190" and - 252" the 
same amount of impurity reduces the strength from 560 g./mm.2 to 
135 g./mm.2 A. Smekal8* concludes that the influence of impurities 
could certainly explain the difference between the ideal breaking 
stress (20,000--40,000 kg./cm.2) and that of the best realisable 
crystal (60 kg./cm.2). If an artificially coloured rock-salt crystal be 
deformed as far as possible, its absorption maximum moves towards 
the red (465 to 475 P).~ The corresponding change in excitation 
energy is 0.05 volt, and if this be interpreted as being the strain 
energy of the lattice at the coloured inhomogeneity, the correspond- 
ing stress is 16,000 kg./cm.2. This value is close to that of the 
theoretical rock-salt crystal and the observation shows that the 
stress at the points where gliding occurs reaches nearly to the ideal 
breakdown stress. As the crystal is progressively deformed, irre- 
versible double refraction91992 first appears at a stress of about 
6 kg./cme2. At the same stress, the photoconductivity begins to 
increase 93 and the ionic conductivity first begins to vary.S3 The 
very beginning of the process of deformation is thereforc connected 
with an increase in the number of inhomogeneities and with the 
break-up of the single crystal. It is therefore improbable that ideal 
gliding ever occurs, and that even in metals, e.g., zinc, where the 
gliding appears so simple, there is from the beginning of the deform- 
ation an irreversible increase in the number of faults in the lattice. 
The plastic properties of rock-salt at temperatures up to 600" have 
been investigated with special reference to annealing and increase 
of strength with plastic deformation.88, 94-g8 Since very small 
amounts of impurities greatly affect the mcchanical properties of 
rock-salt, a method has been devised of observing them by means 
of an ultramicroscope. The number of ultramicroscopic particles 
can be correlated with the mechanical properties and ultra-violet 
absorption.99, 1 The energy imparted to the crystal as a result of

deformation may, in the case of metals, be of a kind which cannot 
be detected by X-rays, i.e., is not accounted for by the change in 
the lattice dimensions.2 In one case it was shown that about O-lyo

Two investigations on quartz 798 have thrown light on 
its previously obscure plastic properties. The production of 
mechanical twins and their demonstration by etching is both striking 
and convincing. The breaking stress under compression is fifteen 
times smaller at the transition temperature, 573", than at room 
temperature. The plastic properties of fluorspar calcite,1° potass- 
ium halides,g2 mica 11 and the nature of the glide planes in a catholic 
selection of substances 12, l3 have also been studied. 
Secondary Structure.-It has been generally assumed that an 
ideal lattice of the rock-salt type is stable. The calculations of the 
tensile strength based on this assumption lead, as was mentioned 
above, to a value several hundred times greater than that observed 
in the best crystals. This led F. Zwicky l4 to put forward the theory 
of '' secondary structure which is, briefly, that superimposed on 
the well-established lattice, known from X-ray diffraction, is another 
lattice on a scale such that its unit cell would have a side about 
1 p long. The planes of this lattice are supposed to contain more 
ions per unit area than parallel planes in the rest of the crystal. 
According to this picture, the crystal would, however pure and how- 
ever carefully prepared, grow with & " block " structure. The 
weakness of the natural crystals is, according to this view, a neces- 
sary consequence of the nature of the secondary structure. This 
hypothesis has been used to explain many of the periodic or pseudo- 
periodic phenomena occurring in crystals and the existence of these 
periodicities, on a scale of about 1 p, has been taken by Zwicky and

others as support for the theory. Smekal has concluded that no 
such hypothesis is necessary to explain the weakness of the natural 
rock-salt crystal, the natural inhomogeneities both mechanical and 
chemical being the prime cause of the diminution of strength. If 
the hypotheses of secondary structure is unnecessary it remains to 
account for the large-scale periodicities. A short account of these 
follows. 
The diffraction effects observed in crystals of potassium chlorate 
were thoroughly investigated by R. W. W00d,15 and he concurred 
with Stokes in interpreting them by assuming periodic twinning. 
As many as 1000 planes, almost equidistant from one another, must 
occur in a single crystal in order to explain the narrowness of the 
spectral band reflected at a particular angle by the crystal. The 
natural (111) faces of perfect crystals of bismuth show fine striz 
intersecting at 60". A. Goetz l6 has attempted to show that the 
distances between the striz are all simple multiples of about 1 p by 
superposing a triangular network of lines on the observed pattern 
and adjusting the size of the triangles until each observed line coin- 
cided with a line of the net. The side of the smallest triangle so 
found is given as 1.4 -+ 0.2 p. The correspondence between net and 
stria? is not convincing, particularly as neighbouring lines are not 
always parallel and their distance apart is only a few times their 
width. Goetz has etched the (111) faces of bismuth crystals very 
carefully, and found that triangular pits are developed. He asserts 
that the sides of these triangles coincide with the lines of the net 
already fitted to the crystal in the previous observation. The 
published photographs do not give much support to this. Another 
line of research has been pursued by M. Straumanis.l7, 18 Crystals 
of cadmium and zinc were prepared by sublimation under carefully 
controlled conditions. The edges of the hexagonal plates so formed 
were bounded by heavily striated faces. A vertical section through 
the crystal showed a step-like formatioil at the edge, arid he found 
that the heights of the steps were approximately whole multiples 
of 0.8 & 0.1 p. Zinc crystals also formed by sublimation were 
deformed so that gliding took place along the basal plane. The 
crystal after deformation appears, when viewed from the side, like a 
pack of cards pushed over to one side. The steps, however, are not 
bounded by vertical faces but by curved sloping faces, showing that 
gliding has occurred also on planes in between those usually denoted 
as slip-planes. The latter are 0.8 & 0-1 p apart, a distance equal to

the height of the steps obtained when the crystal is grown by 
sublimation. It is difficult to judge froni the photographs within 
what limits the separation of the glide planes is a whole multiple of 
0.8 p, but it is clear that the separation is often several times this 
distance. Thus, although the phenomenon of gliding may be 
associated with a lattice the planes of which are 0.8 p apart, they are 
not all equivalent-a fact which distinguishes this type of lattice 
from that determined by X-ray analysis. On a scale about 100 times 
greater than that involved in the above experiments, periodic 
precipitation of cadmium between single crystals of zinc was 
observed by Straumanis.19 Photographs show that the precipita- 
tions occur at intervals which are constant to within about 10% 
and vary according to the rate of crystallisation and the concentra- 
tion of cadmium from about + to mm. Investigations have also 
been made of the etching of various faces of zinc crystals by hydro- 
chloric acid, and in many cases the etching has taken place along 
nearly parallel and equidistant lines. It is important to observe 
that the lines are sometimes not parallel, though the deviation 
from parallelism is small. In a paper zo on the lattice-like 
inclusions of magnesium silicate in calcite from North Burgess, 
Ontario, are some photographs which show inclusions arranged 
parallel and, over a limited region, equidistant. The separation is 
of the order of 0.1 mm. When larger regions are considered it 
would be necessary, if a fundamental repeat distance were sought, 
to choose one not much larger than the width of the inclusions them- 
selves. The inclusions were presumably deposited whilst the crystal 
was solid along the intersections of twin planes. The regularity of 
the spacing of the needles is thus an indication of the regular spacing 
of the twin planes. 
It has been suggested that the discrepancy between the wave- 
lengths of X-rays determined from crystals and from artificially 
ruled gratings is due to the secondary structure.21 The planes of 
the secondary structure are supposed to be of greater density than 
the rest, and this would therefore cause a small error in the deter- 
mination of wave-length. However, there is disagreement between 
various authors 22-24 as to whether there is any discrepancy between 
the wave-lengths obtained by the two methods. Some physical 
properties of bismuth crystals are different according as they are

grown in or out of a magnetic 26 No difference could be found 
between the spacing of the (111) and (111) planes of crystals grown 
in, and of those grown out of, a magnetic field, indicating that the 
changes in physical properties were associated with the way in which 
the blocks of perfect crystal were assembled rather than with the 
properties of the blocks themselves.27 Mention has already been 
made of the reported difference between the thermal expansion 
determined optically and by X-rays for bismuth. This result is 
interpreted as indicating that the portions of the crystal between the 
planes of the secondary structure expand uniformly up to the 
melting point, but that the planes of the secondary structure begin 
to break down at a temperature 35" lower. 
In attempting to form an opinion on the existence of the secondary 
structure from these periodic phenomena, it is important to bear in 
mind our ignorance of the exact nature and origin of the inhomo- 
geneities which are so important in rock-salt. The other substances 
cited were probably not so pure as the rock-salt used by Smekal, and 
a rhythmic separation of the impurities might well give rise to the 
observed phenomena. A special theory is not required to explain 
the separation of cadmium from zinc on a macroscopic scale, and it 
seems unnecessary to introduce one when the scale is reduced a 
thousand- f old.

STRUCTURAL CRYSTALLOGRAPHY. 
The methods of structure analysis have not been radically altered 
in the past two years, but they have acquired additional certainty 
and precision. The Weissenberg goniometer has come more and 
more into use, and, together with other moving-film goniometers,2 
has made the indexing of reflexions and determination of space 
group a purely mechanical operation, so that mistakes on this 
score have practically disappeared. At the same time the use of 
integrating photometers 3 has made photographic intensity deter- 
mination as accurate as ionisation spectrometer measurement, 
thus immensely extending the range of crystals available for com-

plete analysis, especially for organic crystals, where the work of 
the Davy Faraday Laboratory (see below, p. 414) has been so 
outstanding. Fourier analysis, though still very laborious, has 
been undertaken in many cases, and it has become the recognised 
end of a structure determination to give, not only the atomic 
positions, interatomic distances, and angles, but some idea of the 
electronic density at different points in the cell. At the same 
time, methods of handling small crystals,4 amorphous solids, fibres, 
and liquids have so improved that it may now be fairly claimed 
that there is no material, however minute in quantity or unpromis- 
ing in appearance, that will not yield significant information on 
examination with X-ray or electron methods. 
Quite apart from structure analysis, X-ray methods can be used 
for accurate quantitative analysis by measurement of intensities 
of diffraction : this has been used by M. E. Nahmias to study the 
changes occurring in the production of porcelain from clay.6 Of 
more general application have been the methods based on the 
precise measurements of spacing. Lattice dimensions can now be 
measured to one part in 100,000, and without undue difficulty to 
one in 10,000, particularly by a simple method, adaptable to any 
powder camera, developed by A. J. Bradley and A. H. Jay.' 
Dimensions thus obtained are highly characteristic for a pure sub- 
stance. J. ,A. BeardenY8 for instance, found for three samples of 
calcite from different localities spacings of 3-02805, 3.02807, and 
3.02808 A. at 20". However, traces of substances in solid solution 
affect the spacings in a regular manner, and the variation can be 
used to determine the amount of the phase constituents. By 
quenching at different temperatures, or still better by the use of a 
high-temperature X-ray camera: phase boundaries can thus be 
followed with an accuracy which, for the vertical lines of the 
equilibrium diagram, surpasses that of any other method.l* Pre- 
cision spacing measurements have also been used for measurement

CRYSTAL CHEMISTRY. 
Daltonian and Berthollide Compounds. 
Possibly the most interesting development of crystal chemistry 
is that centring round the regular and irregular structure of com- 
pounds and solid solutions. From this field, evidence has been 
gradually accumulating which goes far towards changing our ideas 
on the laws of chemical composition. These laws, in particular 
Dalton’s laws of constant and multiple proportions, were founded 
on the study of simple molecular compounds, hydrogen, oxygen, 
nitrogen, water, carbon dioxide, etc., and binary ionic compounds, 
such as sodium chloride and calcium carbonate. Here these laws hold 
in full rigidity, but there was something in Berthollet’s view that 
they should not be extended to the whole of chemistry. In fact, 
it is only in molecular chemistry-which includes organic chemistry- 
that they are strictly true. In ionic chemistry they break down for 
the simplest ternary systems, as mixed oxide and mixed halide 
systems show, and for the chemistry of ores and metals even the 
conception of valency breaks down completely, and attempts to 
apply it only lead to unwieldy or incorrect formulze. 
The validity of constant composition and valency rules depends, 
we see now, either on dehite directed electron-sharing bonds, or 
on the necessary equality of positive and negative ionic charges. 
The first is true only of molecules or molecule ions (NO,)-,(CH,COO)-, 
the second only leads to simple laws if all the ions of each sign are 
of the same kind. Apart from these cases, regularity may arise 
from the conditions of geometrical packing in crystals. Here it is 
not so much a question of bonds or charges, but of the size and 
shape of the units concerned, atoms, ions, molecule ions, or molecules. 
If the sizes of the various components are very different and the 
structure well fitted together, compounds result apparently of the 
true Daltonian type. Such compounds are NaK, the alums, or the 
molecular compounds of organic chemistry. They differ, however, 
from true chemical compounds by having no existence apart from 
the crystalline state. 
If, however, the different units from which the crystal is built

only differ slightly in size and shape, they may come to occupy 
indifferently the same positions. The simplest case of this kind 
is that of normal solid solution, as of silver and gold or the mixed 
crystal NaC1, KBr, and NaBr which may be written (NaK)(ClBr). 
That size, and not charge or chemical character, is the pre- 
ponderating factor, is shown by the work of E. Posnjak and 
T. F. W. Barth13 in the case of lithium ferrite LiFeO,, which has 
the rock-salt structure with Li+ radius 0-78 8. or Fe3+ radius 0.67 A. 
occupying indifferently the cation positions. A more complicated 
case is presented by the spinels discussed in the last report (1931, 
28, 299). Barth’s theory of interchangeability of ions, which he 
calls “ variate atomic equipoints,” has been established l4 for the 
spinels MgFe,O,, MgGa,O,, MgIn204, TiMg,O,, TiFe,O,, and SnZn,O,, 
but it does not hold for the aluminates of manganese, iron, cobalt, 
nickel, and zinc, and probably not for the typical spinel MgAl,O,. 
This conclusion has been confirmed by F. Machatschki : l5 the previous 
differences had arisen because the observers were working on different 
compounds. The ion equivalence is not confined to cations. E. 
Kordes l0 has prepared spinels of the type (Mg,Li)Al,(O,F),. The 
presence of this extreme form of ion equivalence is, of course, con- 
nected with the high crystallising temperature-in the region of 
lOOO”-of these crystals, That this, however, is not a necessary 
condition is shown by the appearance of the same phenomenon 
in molecular crystals. S. B. Hendricksl7 has shown that the 
crystals of p-chlorobromobenzene and an equimolar mixture of 
p-dichloro- and dibromo-benzene are indistinguishable by X-ray 
methods, the molecule of the former possessing a statistical centre 
of symmetry showing that the intermolecular forces do not in this 
case distinguish between chlorine and bromine. The clearest cases 
of the conditions for interchangeable atoms are furnished by metals. 
Nearly all metals mix in the liquid state, and in the solid not only 
do similar metals, such as tungsten and molybdenum or antimony 
and bismuth, form mixed crystals in all compositions, but the 
face-centred metals y-Mn, y:Fe, P-Co, Ni, Cu, Rh, Pd, Ag, Ir, Pt, 
Au, all form solid solutions in each other, and in most cases these 
are unlimited. (Silver is somewhat exceptional, see p. 387.) In 
such a mixed crystal the atomic positions are rigidly fixed-in this 
case to the corners and face centres of a cube-but any kind of 
atom can occupy any place. In all cases this is the state of affairs

just below the melting point, but in some a further regularity 
appears on slow cooling. For instance, in a mixture of the com- 
position of Cu,Au between 390" and the melting point at 960" all 
the atoms occupy indifferently the points of a face-centred lattice, 
but below 390" the gold atoms occupy the cube corners while the 
copper occupy the cube face centres. Such structures are very 
frequent among metals and have been called " uberstrukturen," 
not very happily translated as '' superstructures." Alloys with 
superstructures differ sharply from solid solutions in their mechanical, 
magnetic, and electric properties,ls which resemble those of pure 
metals : but this is merely an effect of regularity, and they should 
not be considered as compounds unless we carefully distinguish 
between chemical compounds and crystal compounds. Our know- 
ledge of them has been greatly extended by the-detailed quantitative 
study of the iron-aluminium system by A. J. Bradley and A. H. 
Jay.19 Pure iron and FeAl both have atoms arranged in cubic 
body-centred lattices : simply in iron, and with the centres occupied 
by A1 atoms in FeAl (czesium chloride structure). The intermediate 
alloys quenched from higher temperatures showed up to 25 atomic 
yo of aluminium an irregular solid solution of a,luminium in iron, 
between 25 and 50% aluminium an irregular solid solution of iron 
in FeA1, i.e., with all the aluminium atoms not replaced by iron 
still in the cube-centre positions. In annealed specimens a further 
regular superstructure appeared in the composition 25 yo aluminium. 
This FeAl structure is also body centred but with a doubled cell of 
16 atoms, and with iron atoms regularly disposed in half the centres 
of the eight small cubes making up the unit cell. For compositions 
between 18 and 40% aluminium this Structure persists, but X-ray 
intensities show that replacement of iron or aluminium atoms 
takes place in a complex but statistically orderly way, tending to 
approximate to the simple Fe-A1 or FeAl-Fe solid solutions. 
It is clear that in such cases we have to do with a phenomenon 
analogous to the melting of a crystal, referring, not to change 
between the regularity of atomic positions in a crystal and their 
irregularity in a liquid, but to the regular and irregular arrange- 
ments of atoms inside a given crystal structure. Such regular 
arrangement must have a slightly lower potential energy, and 
melts sharply with a correspondingly small latent heat of mixing 
of the atomic species. The melting point is depressed by addition 
of either constituent, as is that of a true compound. Undercooling,

however, is easy, because the transformation requires interchange 
of atomic places; thus slow diffusion hinders the formation of 
superstructures. At low temperatures the irregular solid solution 
is in the same state, as far as position of specific atoms, as a glass; 
it is not in equilibrium but cannot acquire it. The quantitative 
thermodynamic study of such systems has been carried out by 
W. L. Bragg,20 who has been able to show why the more compli- 
cated forms of superstructure such as Fe-Al cannot exist. In this 
connexion, it is worth recalling the recent studies in diffusion in 
the crystalline state, particularly by G. von Hevesy and his 
but also by a great number of other authors.22 There is no space 
here for an adequate discussion, but it may be pointed out that 
the diffusion rate D is given by Qa2INh. e-QIRT, where N is Losch- 
midt’s number, 73 Planck’s constant, a is the shortest distance 
between exchangeable atoms, and Q is the characteristic heat of 
atom interchange of the substance; Q varies from SO kg.-cal. per 
molecule for tungsten-molybdenum to 2.2 kg.-cal. for silver in silver 
iodide, and is itself a function of the characteristic temperature, 
or more simply, of the melting point of the substance = 3b2RTs, 
where b does not vary much from 2. 
In ionic compounds the anion diffusion is not much affected by 
the nature of the cation, but the converse does not hold. The 
velocity of diffusion of silver is least in the fluoride, increases to it 
maximum for the iodide and sulphide, and then falls to low values 
for the metallic AgSb, AgSn, AgAu. The effect of crystal distortion 
or he grain size raises the diffusion constant in some cases by as 
much as 40 times, but does not alter the interchange energy. 
The types of non-Daltonian compound that have been discussed 
can all be brought into line by abandoning an absolute effective 
distinction between atoms or ions of different elementary species, 
and treating them as substitutional mixed crystals. They can be 
formulated in a Daltonian manner by such expressions as 
(NaJX1-5)(ClyBrl--y) or (Fel-,Al,),(Al,,Fe,), where x-and y are no 
longer whole numbers, and where no particular value of x and y 
gives a compound sharply different from neighbouring values. 
There are, however, two other forms of crystalline phase which 
strain the definitions and laws still further, The first of these is

the interstitial compounds discussed in previous reports. The 
metals of the transition groups can, without changing their struc- 
ture, admit small atoms such as hydrogen, boron, carbon, or nitrogen 
into the interstices between them, and these can exist either statis- 
tically distributed or in definite positions. These may be called 
additional solid solutions or additional crystal compounds respect- 
ively, and may be formulated [FeIN, or [PclIH,,. Another non- 
Daltonian type is that called by Hiigg subtraction solid solution or 
compound, and has been studied particularly in the systems Fe-S 23 
and Fe-Se,24 and also in Pe-0 studied by E. R. Jette and F. Foote.25 
The structures found are for FeO the simple sodium chloride struc- 
ture, for FeS the NiAs structure, for FeSe the lead oxide structure 
at high and NiAs at low temperatures. In each case, however, a 
range of solid solution on the iron-poor side exists, and in fact the 
stoicheiometric compound FeO or E’eS cannot be formed at all, in 
spite of the assurance of elementary chemical text books! The 
lattice shrinks as the iron content is reduced, which is consistent 
with the theory that it consists of an ideal lattice FeO, FeS, or FeSe, 
with an increasing number of iron atoms removed, leaving spaces 
which are partially filled by adjustments of the other atoms. Such 
subtraction solid solutions may be formulated (Fe”Fe”’) l--zO, etc. 
They may be expected in metallic compounds, where, owing to 
great difference of atomic type, substitution cannot take place, and 
in ionic compounds where the cation valency can vary. Subtrac- 
tion compounds may exist as well as subtraction solid solutions : 
the y structure of Cu,Zn,, CugA14, etc., can be derived by dropping 
two positions from a three-fold body-centred structure of 54 atoms. 
Another example is the C-sesquioxide type of Mn,O,. This is a 
subtraction compound derived from a two-fold fluorite structure, 
in which one out of every four anions is dropped out, with conse- 
quent slight displacements of all the ions. 
The necessity of considering these non-Daltonian or Berthollide 
compounds (a term first introduced by Kurnakow) 26 in relation 
to the ordinary conceptions and notations of chemistry is becoming 
increasingly urgent, as most metallic and sub-metallic (sulphide) 
systems are essentially of this type, as well as many ionic and 
molecular compounds. A. 0hma11,~’ who has discussed this ques- 
tion from a structural and thermodynamic point of view, proposes

Closely related to the question of mixed crystals and solid solu- 
tion is that of the actual mechanism of separation of a homo- 
geneous crystal phase into two or more others. Recent work, 
particularly that of G. Sachs,28 R. F. Meh1,29 D. W. SmithFO M. L. 
FullerFl and H. HanemannF2 has shown that when an ore metal 
phase separates on annealing into two, the separation takes place 
along certain Lines or planes of the original crystal, giving rise to 
the Widmanstatten structure first observed in meteoric iron. In 
general, it is possible to show crystallographic reasons for the 
mutual arrabgement on the interface between the new phases, the 
general principle being to minimise the amount of atomic inter- 
change necessary. This phenomenon is by no means confined to 
metals : it lies at the back of most of the pseudomorphism, parallel 
growths, mimetic and polysynthetic twinning that occurs in natural 
minerals. The process has been experimentally studied in many 
oxide and hydroxide systems. W. Bussem and F. Koberich33 
have shown that when hexagonal brucite, Mg( OH),, dehydrates to 
cubic periclase, MgO, the latter is oriented with its trigonal axis 
parallel to the original hexagonal axis. As, however, the corre- 
sponding planes are not quite identical, the periclase grows in a 
strained double refracting form which does not become isotropic 
till heated to 1150". Similar observations have been made by 
M. Deflandrew and H. Schwiersch36 on the transformation of 
diaspore AlO(0H) into corundum AI,O,. These reactions are 
essentially similar to the polymerisation of organic molecules in the 
solid to be discussed later (p. 425).

BERNAL AND OROWFOOT. 387 
Crystal Topology. 
The reduction of the multiple observed crystal types to some 
common order based on topological relations between atoms and 
groups is becoming an urgent question, because crystal chemistry 
is largely unintelligible owing to its not being systematised. P. 
Niggli and his school 36 continue their work in this field, but their 
treatment is too formal as yet to have acquired many followers. 
However, the work of F. Laves 37 on the classification of the silicates 
indicates that the method has possibilities, 
CRYSTAL STRUCTURE. 
The number of papers on crystal structure in the last two years 
is still greater than ever before, and. it has become quite impossible 
in the scale of these reports even to mention all the new structures 
described. The principle of selection has been to introduce only 
such investigations as break new ground, or those of wider chemical 
interest. The main lines of classification remain unchanged- 
Metallic, Sub -metallic, Ionic, and Molecular. 
Metallic. 
There has been great activity in the field of fundamental theory 
of metals, particularly of their electrical and magnetic properties, 
but most of this falls outside the scope of a chemical report. The 
work of U. DehlingerF8 however, is of peculiar systematic interest. 
He points out that the properties of metals depend on the one 
hand on the number of free electrons, and on the other, on the 
interaction between the remaining ionic cores. This interaction, 
which is practically nil for the alkali metals, reaches a maximum 
in the transition and coinage metals, where it is the determining 
factor for metallic properties. In particular, he links the colours 
of copper, silver, and gold to the instability (multivalence) of 
copper and gold, compared to the peculiarly stable alkali-like ion 
of silver. In metals of this type, miscibility in liquid and solid 
depends far more on the specific nature of the core than on atomic 
radius. Silver, for instance, though it has almost exactly the same 
atomic radius as gold, is far less miscible in the liquid or solid

state with iron, cobalt, copper, etc. Electrons in metals can fulfil 
three functions. They can be free, belonging to the lattice as a 
whole ; if the number of such electrons differs from the number 
of atoms a p-, y-, or &-structure results; or the electrons can belong 
predominantly to atom pairs, as in gallium, tin, bismuth, and B-group 
metals in general; or they may be bound to the cores, as in mer- 
cury, thallium, and lead, which function in the metallic state 
mainly as Hg, Tl', and Pb" (cf. this vol., p. 120). In general, 
atoms in compounds will not have the same charge as in the element. 
Fe" in iron becomes Fe in iron-zinc alloys, as shown by the alloy 
type and magnetic measurements. There can be resonance between 
different possible states, as in the body-centred compound 
[Cu++Pd+,-]=[Cu+Pd tt3-] , which thus has the required elec- 
tron : atom ratio 3 : 2. We are clearly at the beginning of a 
theoretical metal chemistry of great complexity and interest. Its 
difficulty can be judged by the fact that the Hume-Rothery rules, 
which are more and more recognised as the empirical basis of metal 
chemistry, have not as yet been satisfactorily explained, though 
many attempts have been made, notably by U. Dehlinger,3* H. 
Yerlitz,39 and Laves.40 W. Hume-Rothery himself ha's shown, 
by a study of the alloys of copper with B-group metals, that the 
position of the liquidus and solidus curve is determined by the 
electron and not by the atom content of the solid solution. 
As already mentioned, high precision methods have been much 
applied recently, particularly to pure metals. Separate references 
will not be given, as the measurements up to the middle of 1933 
have been collected by M. Ne~burger.~~ Our knowledge of at least 
one form of structure of the metallic elements is now nearly com- 
plete; we lack knowledge only of scandium, masurium, ten of the 
rare-earth metals , radium, actinium , and protoactiniuin. 
Transition Metals and Their Interstitial Compounds.-Further 
work on structures of transition metals at different temperatures 
has shown that the allotropy of the type of iron is the rule rather 
than the exception. Besides the regular, face-centred cubic, body- 
centred cubic, and hexagonal close-packed, which seem to be the 
iiormel forms at high temperatures, several much more complicated 
structures have been found, often formed by electrolytic deposition. 
These stable low-temperature forms are clearly difficult to get from 
the melt, owing to slow diffusion, and many transition metals are 
probably only known in their simple metastable forms. The

particular structures, thoqh complicated, arc of specid 8ta,bility, 
iis shown by their appearance in more than one metal, as the 58 
atom per cell structure common to y-Cr 43 and u-Mn, the 20 atom 
per cell structure of 8-Mn iound also in Cu,Si, and the 8 atom per 
cell u-W structure found also in Cr3Si.45 The last structure is 
one of some interest. A cubic cell of side 5.03 A. for tungsten 
and 4.55 8. for Cr3Si contains two atoms at the corners and body 
centre, and six others in pairs on each face with co-ordinates 
of the type Oy+y$, O,+,i. This gives a pseudo-icosahedral 12-fold 
co-ordination of the second type of atom (chromium) round the 
first (silicon), which is actually closer than that of normal cub- 
octahedral close packing. 
The mechanism of allotropy has been studied in detail by U. 
Dehlinger 46 in the case of cobalt. The transformation from cubic 
hexagonal close packing takes place reversibly in single crystalg . 
A similar transformation from cubic to tetragonal has been observed 
by L. Graf 47 to occur for the crystal compound AuCu. Much work 
has been done on the solid solution and superstructures among the 
transition metals : references only can be given.48 
Great advances have been made in the study of interstitial 
compounds. K. Becker49 has given an interesting summary of 
our knowledge of their physical properties. Most of them arc, 
exceedingly stable at high temperatures-vanadium carbide melts

above 4000"--aiid are also extremely hard, approaching if not 
exceeding diamond. More work50 has been done on the char- 
acteristic transformations of steel, which are typical examples of 
Widmanstatten structure (see above, p. 386). A. Westgren and 
his school have examined the more complex carbide, boride, and 
silicide systems. In the carbides, including high-speed steel carb- 
ides, the phases studied in order of increasing carbon content were 
the following :- 
(1) Cubic Fe3W3C,51 96 metal atoms per cell. This is really 
a double interstitial structure, being based on a tungsten 
carbide framework held together by iron atoms. Psomorphons 
with this were Fe,W2C, Co3W3C, Ni3W3C, and Fe3M03C. 
This complex 
structure is built from cubes and cuboctahedra of metal atoms 
at an average distance of 2.5 8. apart. Isomorphous with it 
are Ml123c6, Fe,lW2C6: Fe,,Mo2C,, and Cr21W.&&. 
(3) Orthorhombic Ye&. This is the familiar cementite 
structure. Westgren 53 has shown that the structures previously 
put forward for this (Ann. Reports, 1931, 28,294) are incorrect, 
in that the carbon atoms should be placed as in tungsten 
carbide and other carbides inside a trigonal prism, height and 
side 2.66 A. Isomorphous with it are Mn3C and (MnFe),C 
(spiegeleisen) . 
This somewhat unstable compound 
seems to be of Hagg's 12b, 6 type (see ibid., p. 293). 
This has not been further 
studied and may have a more complicated formula. (2) Cubic CrZ3C6,Ii2 92 metal atoms per cell. 
(4) Hexagonal Ni3C.5* 
(5) Trigonal Cr,C3 and Mn,C,. 
(6) Hexagonal V2C and Mo,C, etc., of Hiigg's 12b, 6 type. 
(7) Rhombic Cr3C2.s5 This is the most interesting of the 
new structures. The cell is 11-5 x 5.5 x 2.8 8., space group 
Dit - Pbnrn. All atoms lie in symmetry planes. The carbon 
atoms are placed at the centres of a distorted trigonal prism 
of chromium atoms, and form long zig-zag chains parallel to 
the diad screw axis c, the G-C distance being 1.64 A. Here 
we have no longer a true interstitial compound, but one 
between chromium and dehydrogenated paraffin chains.

(8) Hexagonal WC, MoC, of Hiigg's Sb, 6 type. Here again 
each carbon atom is at the centre of a trigonal prism of tungsten 
atoms. 
The structures of the borides of iron, cobalt, and nickel have been 
studied by T. Bjurstrom : 56 the most interesting is that of FeB, 
in which, as in Cr3C2, the non-metal atoms form a zig-zag chain with 
a B-B distance of 1-78 A. The average radius of the boron atom 
in these compounds is 0.93 A. The silicides of chromium, man- 
ganese, cobalt, and nickel have been studied by B. B~ren.~' The 
most interesting is that of Cr3Si, already mentioned. It is now 
well established that the hydrogen dissolved in palladium exists 
in the form of protons, as the heat of solution exceeds by about 
20 kg.-cals. the heat of dissociation of molecular hydrogen. The 
nature of the solutions and their conductivities have been studied 
by F. Ifiiiger and G. Gehm,58 A. Coehn and K. S~erling,~~ and 
G. RosenhalLG0 The conductivity is partially ionic, but the protons 
only carry a small fraction of an electronic charge, and must conse- 
quently be surrounded in the metal by an electronic cloud nearly 
neutralising them. This property of dissociating hydrogen mole- 
cules is shown to a less degree by nickel, and even less by other 
metals of the eighth group and copper. It is clearly a necessary 
condition for hydrogenating catalysis, but the catalytic efficiency 
falls off as the heat of combination with hydrogen increases ; hence 
nickel is a better hydrogenator than palladium. 
Electron Compounds.-The compounds between transitional and 
B (A) group metals obey Hume-Rothery's rules, and may appro- 
priately be called electron compounds, as their crystal structure 
depends in the main merely on the ratio of electrons to the atoms 
they contain (see above, p. 388). Nearly fifty papers have in the 
past two years been devoted to X-ray work on these compounds : 
it is only possible to mention a small selection. 
The range of alloy system investigated has been much increased 
from the system TiAl 61 to AgLi. In the latter system H. Perlitz G2 
has shown that a true y-phase exists between 76.3 and 80.2 atoms 
yo of lithium. This corresponds to the formula Ag3Li,, and is a 
most important exception to Hume-Rothery 's rules, as no combin- 
ation of univalent silver and lithium can yield the electron ratio

21 : 13. However, its this is the only examplc of a11 alkali y-strue- 
ture yet known, it is perhaps unfair to expect the same rules to hold. 
In the system manganese-zinc, studied by N. Parravano and 
V. Caglioti,a a y-structure is also found, corresponding to the 
formula Mnl.l~2.gZn~~.~lo.l. This obeys the rule satisfactorily if 
we assume that manganese yields no electrons as do iron and 
platinum, or actually absorbs electrons from the zinc. 
The Mn,A1 and &,A1 systems studied by A. J. Bradley and 
P. Jones 64 are very complicated ; so is the FeSn system studied 
by W. I?. Ehret and A. We~tgren.~~ PeSn at high temperatures 
appears to have the NiAs structure. 0. Carlsson and G. Hagg66 
have confirmed the extremely complex superstructures found by 
the author 6' in the CuSn system-the cell of the ?-phase contains 
500 atoms. S. Stenbeck fiinds,68 in a study of the AgHg and AuHg 
systems, that the y-structure appears for a formula Ag,Hg,, exactly 
obeying Hume-Rothery's rules. A. Olander 69 has analysed the 
very interesting structure of AuCd with a tetragonal deformed 
czesium chloride structure which changes above 267" to a true 
c zsium chloride structure . 
A- and B-Group Metals and Their Compounds.-Until recently 
our knowledge of these was practically confined to the structures 
of some of the elements. In the last two years this field has, 
however, attracted much attention, and we are at last in a position 
to form a fairly general picture of its metal chemistry. 
This differs characteristically from that of transition metals and 
electron compounds. Core interaction is much weaker, leading 
to large interatomic distances, so that atomic size is an important 
determinant of crystal type. On the other hand, where B-group 
elements, particularly of the fifth and sixth group, are concerned, 
homopolar- bonds are common, while compounds between A- and 
B-group elements sometimes appear to be quasi-ionic : e.g., Na,+Pb4- 
or Mg; '-Se4-. 
Of the elements themselves, the most interesting new work 
is on the allotropy of beryllium,70 ~alciurn,7~ and probably of

barium.7z Yttrium 73 proves to have a hexagonal structure exactly 
intermediate between strontium and zirconium ; consequently it is 
not clear whether it should be classed as an A-group or a transitional 
metal. Enough rare-earth metals have been analysed to make the 
systematic position of the group clear. The structures are all 
hexagonal, but sometimes also cubic close packed : La (37.0), 
Ce (34.1), Pr (36-3),'* Nd (36.1),'j and Er (36.9) have all the large 
atomic volume characteristic of the A-group Na (39), or the heavy 
B-group metals Pb (30), and much larger than those of the transi- 
tion metals ranging from Zr (23) to Ni (10.9). (The figures in 
parentheses give atomic volume in Most interesting from the 
structural point of view is gallium, which has been very carefully 
redetermined by F. Laves.76 The structure is not, as believed by 
earlier workers, tetragonal, but orthorhombic. Each atom is sur- 
rounded by seven others : one at 2.45, and two each at 2-70, 2.75, 
and 2.79 A. Thus there exist in the solid actual Ga, molecules, 
the first examples discovered in metallic crystals. These molecules 
persist in the liquid, as has been shown by X-ray diffraction," the 
pattern of which differs completely from that of monatomic liquid 
mercury. The molecular nature is particularly interesting, as it 
explains the low melting point, 37". Hume-Rothery's rule (Ann. 
Reports, 1931, 28, 294) by which every B-group metal atom 
should have 8 - N neighbours, where N is its group number, 
seems definitely broken. But only apparently so, for an ideal 
tetragonal structure can be made up in which each atom has five 
neighbours, and this by a slight compression distorts into the actual 
structure with seven neighbours, just as in the case of grey tin of 
co-ordination number 4 passing into white tin with 6. The close- 
packed structures of indium and lead show that for larger atoms 
the generalised metallic attraction is predominant. The transform- 
ations of arsenic and antimony from the amorphous into the glassy 
state have been followed by X-rays and electron diffraction.58 
Our knowledge of the compounds of A- and B-group metals we 
owe mainly to a series of papers by E. Zintl and his coliabor-

The numerous structures studied fall into four main types : 
(1) The simplest is the CsCl type, which appears for Lag, 
LiT1, LiHg, MgAg, MgT1, CaT1, and SrT1. 
(2) NaTl structure. This is a very interesting new struc- 
ture. The cell is a double body-centred structure with 8 atoms 
of each kind. But each kind o€ atom occupies the positions 
of a diamond lattice (000, $$$, etc. and 444, Qfg, etc.). Each 
atom has therefore four neighbours of its own kind and four of 
the other kind, all at the same distance. It is clear that such 
a structure should only occur when the atomic radii of both 
atoms are nearly alike. It is, in fact, found for LiZn, LiCd, 
LiGa, LiIn, NaIn, and NaTl, where the greatest radius differ- 
ence is 0.2 A. Thus in these compounds the alkali metals 
appear to be compressed down to the size fixed by this B-group 
metal. 
(3) A number of alloys of formula AB,, where A is Ca, Sr, 
La, and Ce, and B is Sn, T1, or Pb, form cubic structures based 
on a face-centred lattice of B in which one atom is replaced 
by A. 
(4) Mg,Ge, Mg,Sn, and Mg2Pb have the anti-CaF, structure. 
Other more complex structures have been found, as KBi, 
with the MgCu, structure, a framework of bismuth atoms in 
the large holes of which are the potassium atoms ; and Na,Pb, 
LaAl,, and Li,Sn with large cells. 
Sub-metallic. 
Adamantine Compounds.-The structure of the hexaborides of 
formula B,M, where M = Ca, Sr, Ce, etc., mentioned in the last 
report as possessing an anomalous ion BE, has now been shown 
by F. Laves83 to be really adamantine, consisting of a covalent- 
linked B lattice with the metal atoms in the interstices. Each 
B atom has five B neighbours, one at 1.66 and four at 1-76 A., 
and four metal neighbours. Each metal atom has 24 B neighbours. 
This 4:24 co-ordination is the highest yet found. Essentially 
similar compounds have been shown by A. Schleede and M. Well-

mannS4 to be formed by the action of alkali metals on graphite. 
Compounds C,K and C,,K are formed with potassium atoms 
between each layer or between alternate layers of the normal 
graphite structure. All kinds of carbon so far examined have 
been shown to possess a graphite structure. The differences 
between the physical and chemical properties of different varieties 
are mainly due to the crystal size, which may in the extreme case 
of highly active carbon from benzene be only three layers thick 
and six condensed benzene rings wide, as U. Hofmann s5 has shown. 
Other work86 shows the importance of the edges of the crystallites 
in absorption and catalytic activity. 
Homopolar Crystals of Fifth- and Sixth-group Elements.-Through 
the work of the last two years the gap represented by our ignorance 
of the structures of this important group of “sulphide ores” has 
been largely abolished. It is now possible to present a fairly ordered 
picture of structure types, and to begin to construct a thio-chemistry 
equivalent to the oxygen chemistry of the silicates. Thio-structures 
differ @om oxy-structures, owing to the larger size and greater 
polarisability of the S (Se, P, As, etc.) atoms, so that except for 
alkali compounds they are not ionic. The packing is generally 
closer, owing to increased vitn der Waals forces, but this is offset 
by the smaller co-ordination number of the metal atoms-generally 
4 or 6. The homopolar bonds formed are easily ionised, giving 
the whole crystal a metallic or semi-metallic character. Sulphide 
ores have long been studied by means of their reflecting power, 
and recently F. C. PhillipsS7 has shown that, just as in the case 
of ionic crystals, the molecular refractivities calculated from the 
reflecting power are additive functions of those of the atoms. This 
shows the relative unimportance of structural considerations. On 
the whole, the structures correspond to those of simple oxides or 
halides. Thio-salt complex groups, such as SbS,, do not exist in 
the crystal as separate individuals, but fuse into chains or net- 
works. The general scheme can be set out as follows in order of 
increasing sulphur content, References are only given to struc- 
tures determined in the last two years.

tetrahedron. (Pd, Pt, Ni)S with a more complicated 
structure has been called bruggite, being the first mineral 
discovered by X-ray analysis. 
There may be as many sulphides as oxides of 
this type, which is that of c03s4 and Ni,S,. Fe,S, does 
not, however, appear to be stableYg8 though (FeNi),S,

and ZnCr,S,. 
The extremely important structure oE Sb,S, 
and Bi,S, has at last been analysed, by W. Hofmann.2 
The crystals are orthorhombic; a, b, c are 11-20, 11.28, 
3-83 B., containing four molecules, space group DBX- 
Pbnm, with all the atoms on the symmetry planes. The 
most important feature is the existence of bands of 
antimony and sulphur atoms linked by primary valencies 
lying along the c-axis in the (010) plane. This explains 
at the same time both the needle-shaped habit and the 
excellent cleavage, and is most interesting among the 
sulphides as analogous to the asbestos-like structures in 
the silicates. A3B4, Spinel type.

house 13 have made a very exact Fourier analysis of 
FeS,; Fe is found to carry 26 electrons, indicating the 
essentially non-ionic nature of this compound. The 
distance S-S is 2-14 A., and FeS is 2-26 A. Similar 
conclusions were reached by M. Biierger for FeAs,, 
which has the marcasite structure.

It is clear that this survey of the sulphides is not complete, but 
it does at any rate show the main lines on which sulphur com- 
pounds are built. 
Ionic Crystals. 
The interest in ionic crystals continues unabated-over 250 
papers have been published on them alone-l-ut as now the main 
structural types have been fixed, interest has shifted to points 
with other than purely crystallographic interest, such as the rela- 
tions of oxides and hydroxides, the r61e of water, or the structure 
of complex ions. 
Halides, Oxides, and Hydroxides.-A new fact has been added to 
the structural relations of the alkali halides by G. Wagner and 
L. Lippert's observation that cmium chloride changes its struc- 
ture into that of sodium chloride above 450". The small energy 
difference between these structures is thus experimentally confirmed. 
The most interesting halide structures which have been inves- 
tigatedrecently are those of cadmium, mercury, and lead. J. M. Bij- 
voet and W. Nieuwenkampg have shown that cadmium bromide, 
which, when sublimed has the cadmium chloride structure, when 
precipitated appears in the form of a statisticad mixture of the 
chloride and the iodide structure ; the interleavings cannot be 
more than of the order of one or two layers thick. Incidentally, 
0. Hassel lo has shown that the actual structure of cadmium iodide 
has a cell double that of the hitherto accepted structure. Complete 
analyses have also been made of the structures PbF,,11 PbC1,,12

PbBr2,13 PbClF,1* PbBrE’.15 The first three are isomorphous. 
They may be considered as layer lattices which have been distorted 
into an approximation to a fluoride 8 : 4-co-ordination structure, 
owing to the large size and polarisability of the cation. Actually, 
the co-ordination is 9 : 4 or 5, each lead atom having three bromine 
atoms at 3.0 and three at 3.2 8., all on one side, while on the 
other it has one at 3.3 and two at 4-1 A. There is no evidence for 
a semi-molecular association of lead bromide. The chlorofluoride 
structure is particularly interesting as a typical sandwich structure, 
layers of lead fluoride in fluorite arrangement alternating with a, 
lead chloride layer lattice of the tetragonal lead oxide type. Curi- 
ously enough, lead chlorofluoride has been known for a long time 
as the mineral matlockite Pb,OCl,, but its X-ray pattern led to 
its identification, and a new analysis showed that fluorine had 
been taken for oxygen. H. BraekkenI6 has shown that mercuric: 
bromide has a somewhat complicated layer structure also without 
molecules. 
The trifiuorides 
of Al, Fe, Co, Rh, Pd, etc., do not, like the trichlorides, form close- 
packed layer lattices,l’ but approximate to a cubic lattice whose 
corners are occupied by the cations, while the anions occupy the 
mid-point of an edge between two cations. The structure of 
aluminium fluoride, analysed by J. A. A. Ketelaar,l* shows a 
rhombohedra1 cell containing two such units distorted in an attempt 
to fill the large holes in the cell centres. These holes can be occupied 
with water in the zeolite fashion ; 2AlF3,H20 only loses its molecule 
of water at a red heat. 
N. Wooster 19 has pointed out the essential isomorphism between 
ferric fluoride and tungsten trioxide (see Ann. Reports, 1931, 28, 
296), with which rhenium trioxide 2o bas been shown to be iso- 
morphous. These two structures are the analogues in 6: 240- 
ordination of the 4 : 2-co-ordination structures of beryllium fluoride 
and silica. As in them, the cation can be replaced by one of lower 
charge, the extra charge being made up by an ion in the vacant 
spaces. Thus More work has been done on AX, compounds.

400 CRYSTALLOGRAPHY. 
A stranger case is that of the tungsten bronzes studied by W. F. de 
Jong : 21 here the neutral WO, structure takes up a variable amount 
of metallic sodium in its interstices, giving highly coloured com- 
pounds whose physical properties would be worth investigating. 
Another form of substitution is the replacement of two cations by 
one of higher and one of lower charge. Thus, as Goldschmidt 
predicted, BPO, and BAsO, 22 have essentially the cristobalite 
structure of silica. This is particularly interesting, as in most 
compounds boron appears as 3-co-ordinated. 
The cristobalite structure, the cubic high-temperature form of 
silica, has been much studied. T. F. W. Barth23 has shown that 
both in cubic p-, stable above 240", and orthorhombic cc-cristobalite, 
the oxygen atoms do not lie, as was previously thought, on the line 
between two silicons, but definitely to one side. Thus, in all cases 
where oxygen is found co-ordinated to two cations, we find that 
the lines joining it to them are always inclined at about 140", 
indicating the effect of covalent binding tending towards a valency 
angle of 109". I. Levin and E. Ott 24 first noticed that opal con- 
tains at ordinary temperatures p- or high-temperature cristobalite. 
As R. B. Sosman25 has shown, here can be no question of delayed 
inversion. J. Grieg,26 however, has pointed to the probable ex- 
planation. In opal, as in some glasses, the cristobalite is closely 
adherent to an amorphous matrix. Now, at transition from p- to 
a-, there is normally a contraction of about 4% by volume. Either, 
therefore, the p-cristobalite inverts and breaks away from its matrix, 
as it has been observed to do in certain circumstances, or it fails 
to invert and continues to exist as the stable form under permanent 
tension (negative pressure) from the matrix. In the Report'ers' 
opinion this negative pressure is sufficient to account for the 
appearance of p-cristobalite rather than any other form of silica- 
all with smaller specific volumes-in the slow dehydration of 
massive silica gel, even if the temperature has never been above 
the @-+a! transformation point at 198-270". If this is so, it offers 
some interesting possibilities for finding the negative-pressure forms 
of other materials. Through the work of M. von Stackelberg and 
R. Paulus 88 tcf- 89) we know some of the properties of the ions N3-, P3-. 
The compounds Mg&, Ca3N2, Mg,P2, etc., are ionic in character and

have been shown to possess the anti-C-sesyuioxide type : i.e., the 
ions Mg2 and N3- occupy respectively the positions of 02- and Mn3 t- 
in Mn203. From this, the radii of N3- and P3- are found to be 1.4 
and 1435 A,, very slightly larger than those of 02- and S2- respect- 
ively. The free ions have, of course, far larger radii, but their 
extreme compressibility almost compensates for this. 
We are now beginning to see the place of hydroxides in crystal 
chemistry. The strongly polar nature of the hydroxyl group (OH) 
leads in every case so far examined to a position unsymmetrically 
surrounded by cations, and in particular to layer lattices. The 
structure of lithium hydroxide determined by T. Fhnst 27 proves to 
be the simplest tetragonal layer lattice of the lead oxide type. 
Aluminium hydroxide (hydrargillite) is also a layer lattice, but the 
structure determined by (Miss) H. D. Megaw 28 is far more com- 
plex. Zinc hydroxide in its stable form, analysed by R. Corey and 
R. W. G. Wyckoff ,29 is not a layer lattice, but each hydroxyl is sur- 
rounded by two zinc atoms on one side and two hydroxyl ions on the 
other, while each zinc has four hydroxyl neighbours. An unstable 
form exists with a layer lattice, as shown by W. Feitknecht,3O and 
this forms sandwich structures with zinc halides, carbonates, and 
sulphates. 
In all cases there seems to be a definite attraction between two 
hydroxyl groups attached of different cations, as shown in the 
inset, and this attraction increases with 
the polarising power of the cation, and 
@ consequently with the degree of polaris- 
ation of the hydroxyl group, as shown by @@ 0

It is clear that the apparent neutrality of the hydroxyl groups to 
each other in lithium hydroxide has been replaced by a powerful 
attraction in the case of boric acid, which is only less than that of 
hydrogen-bond-linked oxygens of acids, 2-55 a. (see Ann. Reports, 
1931, 28, 291). This new kind of bond, which may be called the 
double hydrogen bond, still requires theoretical explanation, as the 
simple dipole effect should give increased repulsion rather than 
attraction.

A most fascinating field has been opened in the study of the 
conversion of hydroxides into oxides. The mechanism in magnesium 
hydroxide has been already commented on (see p. 386). That of 
the trihydroxides of aluminium and iron is yet more complicated 
and interesting. This has been investigated by a great number of 
workers, by X-ray and magnetic methods. Both metals form two 
series of hydroxides and oxides, usually known as a and y. In 
each series are a trihydroxide M(OH),, a monohydroxide MO(OH), 
and an oxide M20,. Relationships between them are shown in the 
scheme :

The a-series is the more stable with smaller atomic volume; the 
y-series, on the other hand, is the one usually formed from pre- 
cipitation, and is more chemically active. The structure of the 
ar-trihydroxides has not been determined; it may be similar to that 
of zinc hydroxide. That of the a-monohydroxides, diaspore and 
goethite, has been established by M. Deflandre 34 (p. 386)3 31 and 
S. Goldsztaub.s2 It is essentially a structure of hexagonal close- 
packed oxygens with metal atoms in octahedral holes. Oxygens 
and hydroxyls are distinguished by being symmetrically or asjm- 
metrically surrounded by metal atoms. On dehydration, it passes 
into a parallel aggregate of corundum or hEmatite crystals, a struc- 
ture similarly close packed. 
The y-trihydroxides, hydrargillite and y-Pe( OH),, are layer struc- 
tures (see above, p. 401); on dehydration, they pass without loss 
of crystal structure into the monohydroxides bohmite (the chief 
mineral of bauxite ores) and lepidocrocite (rubinglimmer or common 
rust).s The structure of these is not fully worked out, but it is 
clearly a layer lattice cleaving readily, probably across double 
hydrogen bonds. Its birefringence is strongly negative, 0.57, while

that of goethite is only 0.14 35 (P-386). Lepidocrocite is also formed 
by the oxidation of Fe(OH),,34 by the normal rusting of iron,35 
and by the hydrolysis of ferrites36 (MO,Fe,O,) into which it, but 
not goethite?' can be reversibly reconverted. On dehydration, 
bohmite and lepidocrocite pass into a parallel aggregate of y-Al,O, 
or y-3Fe,03, cubic with a spinel structure 38 containing extra oxygen 
atoms (see Ann. Reports, 1931, 28, 299). The y-Fe203 structure 
holds these oxygen atoms so loosely that it loses them in a vacuum 
even at 250" and is turned into magnetite, Fe304.36 In oxygen, 
on the other hand, it changes at about 600" into the stable cr-PezO, 
form. Lepidocrocite is also, as might be expected from its larger 
volume, unstable to pressure. 0. Baudisch39 ha8 shown that it 
may be converted into a-Fe,03 by grinding at room temperature. 
Fe(OH), is also unstable, undergoing slow autoxidation even when 
kept under anGrobic conditions. 
The most striking property distinguishing the M- and the y-series 
is ferromagnetism, which is characteristic of the latter. The occur- 
rence of this phenomenon in purely ionic compounds is of great 
theoretical interest, particularly from the point of view of their 
magneto-optics, but so far no single-crystal work has been reported. 
Apart from the y-series, a number of ferrites show ferromagnetic 
properties. The nature of these ferrites has been studied, especially 
by H. Forestier 42 and S. Hil~ert.~O They are all of the mixed oxide 
type, of general formula mM0,nFe,03, where M is Li,, Na,, K,, Be, 
Mg, Cu, Sr, Ba, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Pb, AI213, Sn,,,. Most of these 
are ferromagnetic, some with exceptionally low Curie points : for 
LiFeO, and NaFeO, it lies below - 70". Some have special struc- 
tures, e.g., LiFeO, with a rock-salt structure with iron and lithium 
indistinguishable (see p. 382), NaFeO, 41 with a layer lattice of FcO,' 
separated by large Na' ions, and a-BeFe,0,42 with a lepidocrocitc 
structure with beryllium replacing two hydrogens. The great 
majority have spinel-like structures, but with extremely variable 
composition, Sr0,2Pe2O, showing the same structure as SrO,SFe,O,,

suggesting that the structure is simply a stabilised y-Fe,O, structure. 
It is interesting to note that the maximum of ferromagnetism is not 
reached for the true spinel M0,Fe,03, but for an iron-richer solid 
solution 2M0,3Fe203. Others, such as 2Mt10,3Fe,O3, P-BeO,Fe2O3, 
and SnO,,Fe,O,, show the or-Fe203 structure, and are not ferro- 
magnetic. It seemed natural to conclude that the ferromagnetism 
was a structural property of the y-series, but there are several 
indications that this is not the case,39~40 notably the work of G. 
Kurdjumov and his collaborators,43 who prepared ferromagnetic 
mFe203 in an alloy. It is more probable that here, as in metallic 
ferromagnetics, structure plays a secondary rble, the internal 
electronic state of the ion being primary. In ionic compounds ferro- 
magnetism seems to be associated with the state of iron functioning 
as ferrous acid, probably the net acid y-FeO,' H'. It is noticeable 
that the oxidation product of Fe(OH), is ferromagnetic or not, 
according as the medium is alkaline or acid.34 
The oxide-hydroxide relations of cobalt 44 are essentially similar 
to those of iron; those of manganese are more complicated, as 
solid transformations between Mn2+, Mn3+, and Mn4 t are all possible. 
The transformations

all take place without any essential change in crystal structure.45 
The products in all these cases are, however, microcrystalline, as 
they are formed below their recrystallising temperatures : they 
consequently possess large surface and high chemical reactivity. 
These oxide-hydroxide transformations are beginning to become 
intelligible through crystal a.nalysis. It should now be possible to 
attack the related problem of the colloidal hydroxides (e.g., those 
of aluminium, iron, manganese, etc.) so important for physical, 
bio- and geo-chemistry. 
Mixed Oxides.- Of mixed oxides ttic spinel structures have 
already been discussed (see p. 382). The more complex structures 
of the pyrochlorite group have also been much studied. This 
structure bids fair to rival that of spinels in its stability and variety 
of composition. Its essential formula is [A]:-*[B]:O7 (see Ann. 
Reports, 1931, 28, 299), with a cubic cell a z 10.3 8., but the struc-

ture can take up at least one atom of oxygen and four of water 
without swelling noticeably. The essential feature of the structure 
is the 6-co-ordinated Sb5r ion (which may be replaced by Nb5+, 
Ta5', Ti4+ etc.). As L. Pauling 46 has pointed out, antimony never 
appears in any less than 6-co-ordination, and among acid-forming 
ions we should distinguish sharply between the 3-co-ordination of 
(B)3+, C4 t, N5+, the 4-co-ordination of (Al)3+, Si4+, (Ge)4 r, P5+, As5 r, 
S6+, Se6+, CVf, Br74, V5+, Cr6+, Mn7+ and the 6-co-ordination of 
Sn4I-, Sb5+, Te6b, I7'-, Fe34-, Ti4'-, (Zr)4+, Nb"'-, Ta5i-, Mo6+, W6+, 
Re7+. (The elements in parentheses are borderline cases; Mo6+ 
and W6+ are anomalous.) G. Natta and M. Baccaredda47 have 
shown that not only some but all the calcium atoms in Ca,Sb,O, 
can be replaced by $Sb,O, so that the structure of Sb,04 really 
belongs to the pyrochlorite group, and should be written as 
Sbi+Sbi+O,, just as Fe304 is Fe2+Fei+04. Further work on this 
group has been done by 3'. Machatschki 48 and others.49 
8iZicutes.-Since the main outlines of silicate chemistry are known 
(Ann. Reports, 1931,28,301), most of the work done in the past two 
years has been concerned with anomalous or very complex silicates, 
of mineralogical rather than of chemical interest. The exception 
is the determination by W. H. Taylor of the structure of sanidiiic, 
(K,Na)AlSi,O,, which gives the key to that of the petrologically 
essential group the felspars, and thus closes the last important gap 
in our knowledge of silicate types. As anticipated, it proves to be 
based on a somewhat collapsed (Si3A108)1- framework, in the 
interstices of which are found the alkali atoms. Among the more 
complicated silicates studied are those of hemimorphite 52 and 
bertranditeB by T. Ito and J. West, euclase by J. Biscoe and 
B. Warren,54 and zunyite by L. Pa~ling.5~ All are hydroxy- 
silicates, but in no case are the hydroxyl ions attached to silicon, but 
to zinc, beryllium, or aluminium. The silicate grouping is different

Useful structural work has been done on clays and clay minerals ;66 
the different varieties are all based on the same Al(OH)Si20, sheets, 
arranged somewhat differently relatively to each other. The zeolites 
have been much studied, and the structure types proposed by Paul- 
ing (Ann. Reports, 1931, 28, 302), based on various (SiAl)O, frame- 
works, have been confirmed and extended. The natrolite group 
has received the most attention. W. H. Taylor and W. Jackson 57 
have determined the structure of natrolite, Na2A12Si,0,0,2H,0, and 
edingtonite, BaA12Si,010,4H20, the related meta-natro1ite.M Ash- 
cr~ftite,~~ mesolite,sO and thomsonite have been studied by other 
workers. E. Schiebold 62 ha5 determined the structure of scapolite, 
E. Kozu that of cancrenite, both zeolites containing C03. T. F. W. 
Barth 64 has studied the cuboctahedral structure of the sodalite 
group, and in conjunction with E. Posnjak, an interesting set of 
structures derived from cristobalite (see p. 400) by replacing half 
the Si4+ ions successively by A13+ and Ca2+ without essential change

Albite Na(AlSi,O,)- --+ Anorthite Ca(Al,Si,0J2- 
Complex Ions.-The work of the last two years, represented by 
over 100 papers, now makes it possible to review the types of com- 
plex ion in a wider and more rational scheme. In the first place, it 
is necessary to have a physical definition of a complex ion. The 
most general is : a charged group of atoms (closed or open) for each 
atom of which the forces attaching it to the group are greater than 
the forces attaching it to other atoms. Applying Pauling’s rules to 
the simplest case of an ion of the type Bb+X:-, we can see that this 
will always be a definite complex ion if b/n>x/2, for here the partial 
valency joining B to X, being greater than half the charge of X, no 
other valency can equal it. For oxy-ions the rule is simplest : 
an atom will always give a stable oxy-ion when its maximum valency 
is greater than its co-ordination number ; e.g., C4+03, P5+04, 17+06. 
For fluoride ions, twice the valency must be greater than the co- 
ordination number; e.g., B3+F4, Si4+F6. This rule gives a lower 
limit to the stability. Ions with weaker internal forces can, how- 
ever, exist in f avourable circumstances, i.e. , in the presence of large 
ions such as K’ or Cl’. This is the case with co-ordinated ions of 
the type Ni(NO,):-. Oxy-ions of this type, however, inevitably 
hydrolyse in water, e.g., Sn0;- -+ Sn(OH)i-. The ions for which 
b/n = x/2 tend to polymerise by sharing X atoms. Thus (B3+03)3- The same transition of physical properties without

b ‘7 ‘0 0’ \O,B,O/ = (BO,)’ ions,75 (Si4+O4)” gives 
0. (Si0J2- chains, etc. ; AlFi- and WOE- give framework structures. 
Where there are homopolar forces inside the ion, as in organic and 
quasi-organic ions, e.g., the dithionate ion, the question of ionic 
stability merges into that of molecular stability. 
Ions can be divided into mononuclear and polynuclear types. 
The former are of the general form B&[n = (0),1,2,3,4,6] ; the 
latter consist of mononuclear ions bound together either (a) through 
X atoms (generally 0), or (b) by covalent bonds between B atoms. 
The (a) type are represented by pyro- and per-ions and by the 
silicates; (b) by most organic ions. We limit by convention 
inorganic polynuclear ions to those which are fairly compact and 
symmetrical in structure. The simple mononuclear ions are sym- 
metrical and linear, triangular, tetrahedral, or octahedral in shape. 
From them we can derive asymmetrical ions, either by removing X 
atoms, leaving a reduced ion with electron pairs (Zachariasen’s

principle, see Ann. Reports, 1931, 28, 297), or by choosing different 
kinds of X atoms, by substituting, e.g., F, S, or N for 0 in an oxy- 
ion.65 The substitution of hydrogen to form a hypo-ion is an 
extreme case of this. The substitution of hydroxyl for oxygen or 
simple addition of hydrogen ion, leading to an acid ion or acid, does 
not change the form, or, in general, the symmetry of the ion, owing 
to the partial ionisation of the hydrogen in a hydrogen bond. 
Two types of anomaly are apparent : those such as SeBrg- and 
VPl-, where the co-ordination is normal but the valency too low, 
and those such as W0:- and OsOj, where the valency is normal but 
the co-ordination too low. 
Crystal-structural investigations have been able to throw con- 
siderable light on the nature of co-ordinated ions. A. Ferrari and 
C. Colla6' have measured a series of salts containing the ions 
[Co(N0,),l3- and [Ni(N0,)6]4-. All form cubic face-centred cells, 
a z 10 A., determined by the complex ions, various numbers of 
K,NH,,Ba,Pb, etc., filling the interstices of the structure. Complete 
analysis was not attempted, but the published dimensions of the 
cell exclude, in the Reporters' opinion, the possibility of an electro- 
static co-ordination Co+ -ONf and are only compatible with a 
0 covalent Co-NO co-ordination. 
The square planar configuration of the PtX, and PdX, ions, which 
can be considered as derived by removing two X atoms from the 
octahedral PtX6 ion, has been fully confirmed by structure analyses 
on single crystals. R. M. Bozorth and L. Pauling68 find planar 
configuration in Mg2PtC1,,7H20, while E. G. Cox in a series of 
papers 69 demonstrates it in [Pd(NH,),]Cl,,H,O, [Pt(NH,)4]C1,,H,0, 
Pt(NH,)2C12,70 and most clearly of all in the " green salt of Magnus " 
[Pt(NH3)4][PtC14],71 where the + and - planar ions are piled

The stxucturo of K[Ag(CIN),] 11:~ been studied b)y ?J. L. Hoard '' 
and the Ag(CN), groups found to be linear: this may be regarded 
as the last stage in removing substituents from a BX, complex. A 
similar linear arrangement has been found by H. M. Powell 73 in the 
dialkylthallium ions. 
We are not yet in a position to classify the polynuclear ions. 
Those of the pyro-type sharing oxygen (or fluorine) are fairly familiar 
through the silicates. The most valuable addition is the three 
co-ordinated chain ion studied by W. H. Zachariasen 74 in calcium 
metaborate (see p. 407). The homopolar type is represented by the 
dithionate ion. G. V. Helvig,75 G, Hiigg,76 and M. L. Huggins 77 
are now all agreed that the ion consists of two pyramidal SO, groups 
joined point to point through the sulphur atoms in octahedral 
configuration. The hypophosphate ion, O,P-POi-, is probably 
isomorphou~.~~ In connection with the heteropoly phospho- 
tungstate ion P(W,O,,);- mentioned in the Report (p. lOS), it should 
be noted that, if the structure proposed is correct, it would require 
us to modify our conceptions of the laws of ionic structure, for one 
02- ion has as neighbours three W6+ ions and one P5+ ion, giving it 
an equivalent charge of 49 electrons instead of its usual two, whilc 
other oxygen ions receive a charge of only one electron. 
The Salts.-Apart from information on the nature of ions, much 
work of crystal structural interest has been done on the salts. In 
ABX, compounds with flat ions, optical anisotropy is an important 
property, and has been much studied.79 S. B. HendricksgO has 
published a full account of the changes of structure in ammonium 
nitrate due to ion rotation (see Ann. Reports, 1931,28, 291). V. M.

Ann. Reports, 1931,28, 297) ; the mineral constituent of bone and 
teeth is shown to be hydroxy-apatite, Ca3( OH)Ca,(PO,),. The 
hydroxy-ion is very tightly held, and cannot be removed below 
1400". The structures of the beautiful copper carbonate minerals 
azurite, Cu,( OH),(CO,),, and malachite, Cu,( OH),C03, have been 
studied by M. Brasseur.88 The structures are complicated, and are 
true hydroxy-carbonates, not sandwich structures, CuCO,Cu( OH),, 
AS usually written. Other polyionic salts, such as northupiteYsg 
Na3MgCI(C0,),, and it8 related salts, have been studied with some 
success. 
Our knowledge of water of crystallisation has been much increased 
by the determination of the structures of Be(H,O),SO, and 
Ni(H,O),SO, by C. A. Beevers and H. Lip~on.~Q Ineachcase the water 
molecules are co-ordinated to the cation, the co-ordination number 
being determined by the ionic size. The water molecules act as 
distributors of the ionic charge, each touching two oxygens of 
different SO, groups carrying an electrostatic valency of S and & in 
the beryllium and nickel sulphates respectively, each sulphate 
oxygen being accordingly touched by two water molecules belonging 
to different beryllium ions or three belonging to different nickel ions,

Moleczclar Crystals. 
Although X-ray methods were from the beginning used to study 
molecular and, in particular, organic crystals, it is only in the last 
few years that they have begun to yield information of positive value 
to chemists. This was because, owing to the intrinsic difficulties of 
organic crystal analysis, the results obtained were in the case of 
simpler compounds too rough to do more than confirm the chemical 
evidence, while compounds where information of any kind would 
be of use were generally too complicated in structure to yield to 
the X-ray methods of the time. 
Now, however, improvements in crystal analysis technique and a 
more extensive knowledge of the nature of molecules and of intra- 
and inter-molecular forces have changed all this, and results 
already achieved justify the claim of crystal analysis as an important 
and ultimately essential adjunct to structural chernistr~.~~ Every 
stage in the crystal analysis of a molecular compound may be of value 
from the chemical standpoint. These stages may be summarised 
as follows : 
(1) X-Ray photograph of the crystal, either as powder or single 
crystal. This is a very powerful means of identification. The 
angular positions and the intensities of the reflexions are equivalent 
to so many characteristics, each of the value of a melting point or 
other single physical determination. It has been used, for instance, 
in showing the substantial identity of adenine hydrochloride with a 
preparation of vitamin-B, (p. 424). 
(2) Determination of cell size. This, in conjunction with a know- 
ledge of the density, furnishes the most accurate method of absolute 
molecular-weight determination. The limitations of this method 
depend only on that of the density, which is difficult with very small 
or cracked crystals. The weight obtained is in general some simple 
exact multiple, e.g., 2, 4, 6, 8, of the true molecular weight, but this 
multiple can be found at the next stage. 
(3) Determination of space group and molecular symmetry. This

is effected from X-ra,y photographs combined with a determination 
of polarity by piezo- 96 or pyro-electric methods,97 or by etch 
figures. The first use to which this information can be put is the 
determination of the maximum molecular size. The minimum size 
cannot be determined, as all the molecules in a cell may not occupy 
crystallographically equivalent positions, even when no polymeris- 
ation has taken place. Thus, it is possible to distinguish between 
pure substances and molecular compounds, as in the cases of calci- 
ferol and quinhydrone (see pp. 423, 420). The actual molecular 
symmetry is, of course, of stereochemical importance in many cases, 
but here again the crystal analysis only gives a minimum symmetry, 
as molecules in general will not be able to pack so as to exhibit their 
highest symmetry (cf. benzene, p. 419). 
For this the 
X-ray evidence may be supplemented by evidence from physical 
properties-habit, cleavage, etc.-but most importantly by a know- 
ledge of the optical or magnetic anisotropy of the crystal. In a 
molecular crystal where the intramolecular forces are strong and the 
intermolecular forces weak-as in nearly all organic crystals-the 
molecule behaves in the crystal very much as in a gas, and con- 
sequently the anisotropy of the crystal is a mere product of that of 
the individual molecules and of their mutual orientations. 
Now the optical (or magnetic) anisotropy of a molecule is closely 
related to its shape-long molecules are positive, flat molecules 
negative, and round or compact molecules quasi-isotropic. If 
molecules pack parallel in a crystal, the optical character of the 
crystal is that of the molecules. If, as is more rarely the case, their 
axes lie in a plane, the character is inverted, i.e., long molecules 
arranged at right angles give negative birefringence. If there is no 
selected common direction, quasi-isotropy results for every type of 
molecule. 
It is nearly always possible from such indications to find the 
disposition of the molecules in the crystals, and hence their size and 
shape, even when the molecular structure is quite unknown, as has 
been done, e.g., for vitamins B, and C (ascorbic acid, see p. 424). 
Once the size and shape of the molecule are known, many questions 
with respect to its structure can be answered. The method is 
essentially a negative one. Of proposed structures, some can be 
excluded as having inadmissible shapes, though at this stage it is 
impossible to be sure that a given admissible structure is the correct 
one. It was in this may that the new sterol formula was first 
deduced (see p. 423). The greatest difficulties are encountered (4) General arrangement of molecules in the cell.

where (u) the molecules are geometrically and optically quasi- 
isotropic, (b) intermolecular forces are large, as in poly-alcohols and 
acids, (c) the molecule is not rigid but protean in shape, owing to the 
existence of internal rotations. Thus the sugars and simple vegetable 
acids, where all these disadvantages occur together in varying degree , 
have not yielded anything significant to X-ray analysis, compared 
to that yielded by aromatic or paraffinoid types. 
Once the rough positions 
of molecules in a crystal are known, the exact positions of the atoms 
can be found by a laborious process of trial and error, so as to give 
a good agreement between observed and calculated intensities of 
reflexion. 
(6) Determination of electronic densities (Fourier analysis) (see 
Ann. Reports, 1929, 26, 280). Starting from approximate atomic 
positions, the phases of the diffracted beams can be found. This 
gives their complex amplitude, and hence by Fourier analysis a 
complete picture (usually a two-dimensional projection) o€ the 
electronic distribution can be obtained (see Figs. 1 and 2). Prom 
this, interatomic distances and valency angles can be read off, and 
these final values are, owing to the method of successive approxim- 
ation used, independent of any original assumptions about the 
structure of the molecule. 
This chain of operations is divided clearly into two parts, vix., 
(1)-(4) and (5) and (6). The first is straightforward measurement, 
involving little calculation, and for any crystal species may take 
between a day and a week. The second calls for much experience 
and intuition, refined measurements of intensity, and heavy corn- 
putations , running into several thousands of operations for one 
crystal, and the time taken must be reckoned by months. It is 
plain, therefore, that far fewer crystals can be determined by this 
complete intensive method than by rapid preliminary methods more 
adapted to extensive surveys. The two sides of the work are inter- 
dependent. Extensive surveys suggest which crystals will yield 
the most useful results if intensively analysed, while the results of 
intensive analysis provide data on intra- and inter-molecular 
distances useful in building up rough models of crystal structures, 
particularly in stage (4). 
The chemical implications of these two aspects are also different. 
Intensive analysis provides fundamental information on stereo- 
chemistry and the nature of the chemical bond. It is one of the 
chief means of transformation from the classical qualitative, topo- 
logical, chemistry of the nineteenth century to the quantum- 
mechanical, metrical chemistry of the present day. The extensive 
method is more closely connected with the practical development of (5) Determinution of atomic positions.

chemistry in analysis and synthesis, particularly in dealing with 
complex biochemical problems. Here the chemist and the crystallo- 
grapher must work in intimate collaboration. A large number of 
related substances and derivatives are prepared and examined, and 
from their crystallographic relations more can be discovered than 
from an elaborate analysis of any one of them. There is no doubt 
that, if chemists were more aware of the possibilities of these 
methods, there mould result an enormous saving of time and effort. 
The work is 
a continuation of that of (Sir) W. H. Bragg at the Royal Institution, 
chiefly by J. M. Robertson and (Mrs.) K. Lonsdale. Including some 
earlier work, particularly that of It. W. G. Wyckoff, thc only crystals

With each crystal type are given the intramolecular distances which 
can be derived from it. These, together with the 1-54 A. distance 
derived for the aliphatic bond from diamond, and the value 1-42 A. 
for graphite, represent all the determinations of interatomic distances 
justifiable by X-ray measurement. Values are quoted by N. V. 
Sidgwick 08 for many other bonds, but, except where they depend on 
spectral data for symmetrical diatomic molecules, they are of the 
nature of predictions only. This is particularly the case for distances 
derived from electron diffraction, except for the simplest molecules 
of the BX, type, where they are least liable to interpretative error. 
A summary of this work is given by L. Bru.' 
The table also contains values of intermolecular distances, but 
these have not the same precise significance. For most organic 
molecular compounds covered by neon-like electronic orbitals (other 
forms occur only in compounds containing sulphur, chlorine, etc.) 
the distance between atoms in neighbouring molecules is determined

value of about 36---4.0~\. This is only slightly greater than the 
distance 3.41 8. between the hydrogen-less molecular sheets of 
graphite. The presence of hydrogen atoms does not affect the 
distance much, as they are embedded in the electronic cloud of the 
atoms to which they are bound. If, however, they are part of a local 
dipole, as in hydroxy- or amino-groups, the interatomic distance 
may be reduced to 3-3.2,&., or in the extreme case of acids, a 
hydrogen bond may reduce it to 2-55 8. 
All other work on molecular compounds is either of crystal 
physical interest, as showing how known molecules pack in a crystal, 
or of direct analytic interest, as leading to a structural formula 
which still remains to be proved by chemical methods. The results 
may be classified under : (1) Simple molecular compounds, includ- 
ing not only inorganic molecules, but organic compounds with 
compact molecules (pentaerythritol derivatives, etc.) . (2) Long- 
chain molecules. (3) Ring molecules, simple, multiple, and con- 
densed. 
Simple MoZecukcr CrystaZs.-Much work has been done on hydridc 
structures.l Although the essential picture is that of close packing 
(Ann. Reports, 1931, 28, 303), yet in almost very case there exist 
low-temperature forms with lower symmetry, usually tetragonal. 
The transitions in the solid are clearly due to dipole rotation, as has 
been shown by C. S. Hitchcock,2 by the appearance of high dielectric 
constants at the transition temperatures, the only temperature at 
which the molecules are neither freely rotating nor fixed, and can thus 
respond to the electric field. Similar effects have long been known 
for ice and the alcohols, but curiously enough are not found for solid 
ammonia. M. Ruhemann has shown that a-nitrogen (above 35" K.) 
is hexagonal close packed, as against the cubic close packing of 
a-nitrogen. The molecular polyhalides of the types BX,, BX,, 
BX,, BX, have been studied in the solid by X-raysY4 and in the liquid 
and vapour both by X-ray and electron 6 methods. Electron

methods have also been used by K. Wierl and L. Bru for a whole 
set of simple molecules, hydrocarbons, halides, ethers, etc. In all 
these cases the structure determination depends on the interpre- 
tation of a small number of diffuse diffraction rings; it can only be 
of value in the simplest cases, and then only for the measurement of 
rough interatomic distances and valency angles. A very interesting 
application of electron diffraction is, however, shown by A. Stock 
and R. Wierl’s 8 work on the compound B,N,H,, which shows the 
same pattern as benzene, and should therefore be formulated as in 
(I). Other such cyclic inorganic compounds have been investigated. 
HH 
(PNCI,), and (PNCl,), have been shown by F. M. Jaeger to have 
the structures like (11) ; S,N, and H,S,N, lo are apparently more 
compact. Most interesting, however, is further light on the struc- 
ture of sulphur.ll E. Hertel l2 has shown, by examination of the 
trigonal molecular compounds CHI3,3S,, As13,3S,, that the S, 
molecules not only have a plane of symmetry but must be piled 
above each other in the direction of the c-axis at a mutual distance 
of 4.44 A. This is only compatible with a disc-shaped molecule of 
external diameter z 6.6 and thickness z 4.4 d. The most probable 
configuration is therefore a cyclic molecule derived from a cube 
flattened into a puckered octagon. A more careful analysis of this 
compound would give more information on the nature of the sulphur 
molecule than a study of the element itself. 
G. Wagner and G. Dengel l3 have investigated the tetrahalides of 
pcntaerythritol, finding simple cells with halogen atoms lying in 
planes, but the Reporters have reason to believe that the real struc- 
tures are more complicated. The only other apparent exception found 
by X-ray analysis to the tetrahedral carbon atom is that of dibenzyl- 
idenepentaerythritol (see Ann. Reports, 1929, 26,304), the molecule

of which was found by F. M. Jaeger to have three diad axes of 
~ymrnetry.1~ One of the Reporters l5 has recently found that this 
is incorrect, as the crystal is really trigonal, not hexagonal, and in 
the molecule consequently only one diad was of symmetry, which 
is fully compatible with the tetrahedral carbon atom. 
R. W. G. Wyckoff and R. B. Corey have continued their work on 
urea and its derivatives thiourea l7 and methylurea,l8 and have 
furnished valuable precise interatomic measurements (see Table I) 
and also P curves for carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen. F. V. Lenel19 
has continued his work on the polypeptides. Glutathione, the 
basic respiratory peptide, has been examined by J. D. Bernal,20 
who has shown that its three amino-acid units are arranged in a 
straight chain. 
E. G. Cox 21 is making progress in the field of the sugars, but so 
far the difficulties have been too great to put forward any complete 
structure. 
Long-chain Compounds.-A. Miiller 22 has shown that the cyclo- 
paraffins C,H,, (n = 12-30) are essentially similar to the normal 
parafhs in structure, the flexible ring being drawn out under the 
influence of residual forces into a double chain with a small ring 
involving 1-3 carbon atoms at each end. The cross-section of the 
straight part of the ring is 37.5 almost exactly double that of a 
free paraffin, vix., 18.3 k2. More remarkable are the apparently 
greater intermolecular forces, especially in the low-carbon members : 
cycZododecane has, for instance, a density of 0-945 compared to 0.77 
for dodecane. The rotation of the carbon chains of the paraffins in 
the solid state has been well established by his further work,23 
showing that it is complicated by other forms of polymorphism for 
hydrocarbons higher than C24. These rotational forms have been 
studied optically for hydrocarbons a’nd alcohols by N. Yannaquis 24 
and J. D. Berna1,25 where they appear as uniaxial hexagonal crystals.

almost certainly planar, but the best evidence for this comes from 
the study of more complex aromatic structures, in particular durene, 
1 : 2 : 4 : 5-tetramethylbenzene, for which a complete Fourier 
analysis was carried out by J. M. Robertsona5 (see p. 413 and 
Figs, 1 and 2). It is interesting to note that the mutual repulsion 
of methyl groups in the o-positions made them deviate from the 
radial orientation. Other benzene derivatives have been less 
thoroughly studied. p-Dichlorobenzene has been already mentioned 
(p. 382). The plane of symmetry reported for m-dinitrobenzene 36 
(see Ann. Reports, 1931,28,306) has now been shown by piezoelectric 
measurement 96 not to exist. Of particular interest are the struc- 
tures of quinone, corrected from optical and magnetic measurements 
by K. S. Krishnan and S. Banerjee?' and that of quinhydrone 
determined by 0. R. Foz and J. Palacios.38 The cell is monoclinic, 
space group Cih - PZ,/n, but in it there is only one molecule of 
quinone, and one of quinol, and these must be derivable from each 
other by a symmetry axis. The only coizclusion is that here we havc 
to do with no molecular compound, but with a new type of chain 
polymeride held together by hydrogen bonds : 
This would explain both the peculiar oxidation-reduction properties 
of the substance, and its extreme optical pleochroism. The crystals 
are practically black for vibration directions along the macro- 
molecule, even when transparent and showing Newton's colours for 
the other vibration. In vapour and solution, ring polymerisation 
may take the place of chain polymerisation. 
The most complex benzene derivative studied is the mineral 
mellite, A12C,,0,2,18H,0, which has a large tetragonal cell with 
16 m0lecules.3~ E. Halmoy and 0. Hassel's work in cyclohexane 
derivatives 40 shows iairly conclusively that here the atoms do not 
lie in a flat ring. 
The essential nature of polyphenyl structures has now been 
established. Diphenyl itself has been measured by J. Dhar 41 and 
by L. W. Pickett 42 by the X-ray method, and the molecular orient-

has also published a Fourier analysis of p-diphenylbenzene (cf. 
Hertel) ,45 and preliminary results for pdiphenyldiphenyl40 (bis- 
diphenylyl). In these compounds the structure found shows that 
the benzene rings are flat hexagons which in any one molecule lie in 
the same plane. The value for the distance C-C between the rings 
was 1.48 pi., ie., intermediate between those observed in aromatic 
and in aliphatic carbon atoms. The implication is that the Ph-Yh 
bond does not easily admit of rotation. This is further confirmed by 
the analysis of s-triphenylbenzene by (Mrs.) K. L0nsdale,~6 where 
a11 rings lie in a plane. 
In a similar way J. M. Robertson 47 has established the structure 
of the basic condensed ring systems naphthalene 47 and anthracenq48 
and with J. Iball 49 extended this study to chrysene and 1 : 2 : 5 : 6- 
(1 ibenzanthracene. Condensed ring systems form flat rigid mole- 
cules, which with increasing number of rings tend to pack more and 
more in parallel sheets approximating to the structure of graphite. 
Stilbene, tolane, and o-azotoluene have been described by 1LI. 
Pra~ad.~* The crystals all show similarities with those of azo- 
benzene. The -N=N- and -CEC- are equivalent in length 
within the errors of experimental measurement, -C=C- is some- 
what longer. To this group also belong the aromatic disulphides 
and diselenides measured by L. Egartner, F. Halla, and R. Scha- 
~herl.~l The series included diphenyl and dibenzyl disulphides and 
diselenides, and dibenzoyl disulphide. The parameters of the sulphur 
and the selenium atoms were determined, and their radii from the 
distance between the two centres found to be in both cases 1.19 A,, 
rather larger than the values S = 1-04, Se = 1-13 A. found in the 
elements. This is probably the half length of the S-S (Se-Se) single 
bond. The straight character of dibenzyl derivatives is maintained 
for similar multiple-linked phenyl groups such as dibenzylidene- 
benzidine or diethyl pp’-xylylidenebisaminocinnamate, as shown by

thc work of' J. 1). Hwid 52 and K. Herrinmn53 on tho crystal 
structures of substances giving rise to liquid crystals. 
E. Hertel* and his co-workers have examined a number of the 
substitution products of trinitrobenzene, and also several molecular 
compounds.55 It seems a pity that in this work the optical proper- 
ties of the crystals generally are not measured, as these should assist 
in the structure determination far more than the theories of mole- 
cular packing put forward. This is particularly the case with the 
interesting observations on colour dimorphism in which one might 
correlate change of colour with the actual alteration in the mutual 
arrangements of chain and ring systems rather than with chemical 
interaction. Among condensed ring systems, J. Hengstenberg and 
J. Palacios56 have shown that the two anthracene molecules in 
dianthracene are probably linked at the 9 : 9'-positions, the anthra- 
cene ring system being slightly bent at thc centre to enable this 
linking to take place. 
There has been a, certain increase in X-ray measurements taken 
rather for purposes of identification of the compounds than for 
structure determinations. A very complete series is that of deriv- 
atives of ephedrine and $-ephedrine:' where the measurements 
should prove sufficiently complete to lead ultimately to the exact 
structures. 
In the last two years a number of important groups of biochemical 
compounds, the sterols, the bile acids, the female and the male 
sexual hormones, as well as other substances, pre-mandiol, digitoxin, 
bufotoxin, etc., have been shown to be based on a common condensed 
ring system. The establishment of this common skeleton was due 
initially to X-ray investigation of one of its more complex members, 
calciferol (vitamin D). The chemical proofs of the new sterol 
formula are dealt with in another part of these Reports (p. 198), but 
it is here of some importance to state precisely how the methods of 
crystal analysis were of use in settling difficul6 points or indicating 
possible lines of attack. The following summary is arranged in 
roughly chronological order.

(I) 'l'bt: first crystal structural investigatioii of calciferol aid its 
related compounds 58 and of cholesterol and ergosterol showed (a) on 
the evidence of the space group and number of molecules in the cell, 
that calciferol was a simple substance (see p. 412) ; (b) on evidence 
of cell size and optically determined molecular orientation, that the 
sterol molecule must occupy a space 5 x 7.2 x 17-20 A. and must 
form in the crystal a double layer similar to that of long-chain 
alcohols. This showed that the accepted skeleton (111) must be 
wrong in at least two essential points : (i) the sharing of one carbon 
atom by rings I, 11, and 111, for this would lead to a much thicker 
molecule, and (ii) theattachmentof thelong chain at C,,, which would 
lead to a much shorter molecule than that observed. Purther, 
(iii) the double layer pointed to a hydroxyl group placed terminally 
in the molecule. (This was confirmed later by an examination of 
$-cholesterol, which with a hydroxyl jn ring I1 shows no double 
layer.) 
(2) Meanwhile, a concurrent but fortuitously uiidertaken investig- 
ation of cestrin 59 pointed strongly to a structure with a phenanthrene 
nucleus of approximately the same molecular width and thickness. 
A little later it was apparent that pregnandiol,60 which was already 
known to be related through the bile acids to the sterols, had also 
very similar molecular dimensions. 
(3) These were the considerations from crystallography that, 
added to the serious chemical defects of the old sterol formula, led 
Rosenheim and King61 to propound the new formula (IV) sub- 
sequently amended to (V), which accounted for all the features 
occurring in the crystal analysis. \/

thinness of the molecule was made more certain by an examination 
of cis- and truns-hexahydrochrysenea 62 synthesised by G. R. Ramage 
and R. Robinson, of which only the former showed no resemblance 
to a sterol derivative. 
(5) The attempt to settle the nature, 5- or 6-membered, of ring 
IV has led to much work on the hydrocarbons derived from the 
sterols, in particular Diels's hydrocarbon CI8Hl6. While it has 
been impossible to determine its structure, X-ray and optical 
methods have shown that it is not cycZopentenophenanthrene,@ 
and its resemblance to retene suggested the structure y-methyl- 
cyczopentenophenanthrene. This was subsequently synthesised by 
E. Bergmann64 and by G. A. R. ICon65 and appears to be indis- 
tinguishable from the natural product. 
(6) Much further work is in progress, in particular on the position 
of the double bonds. Here, both X-ray and optical theory66 
suggest but cannot prove that in ergosterol these lie in rings I 
andlor 11. 
Similar but less extensive work has been done on vitamins B,, 
B4,67 and C. The structural formula of the last, now known as 
Z-ascorbic acid (VI), was established, as in the case of the sterols, This is still in opposition to current chcmicd opinion.

Fibre Xtructures. 
A discussion of X-ray work on fibres requires a separate report : 
here we can only mention the most salient advances of the last two 
years. The whole subject has been admirably summed up by 
W. T. Astbury in “ Fundamentals of Fibre Structure ” (Oxford, 
1933), and in shorter articles.71 
The simplest fibre substances studied are the polyoxymethylenes. 
Crystallographic research on these, chiefly carried out by H. W. 
Kohlschiitter and L. Sprenger72 and E. Sa~ter,~~ has been able 
to show precisely how the polymerisation takes place, and has 
probably given the clue to the mechanics of polymerisation in all 
chain polymeride systems. Trioxymethylene crystallises in the 
hexagonal system with six-ring molecules arranged in order along 
the hexad axis : 
On exposure to light in the presence of free formaldehyde, nuclei 
appear in the crystals, and starting from them fibrous polyoxy- 
methylene appears, the fibre axis lying along the hexagonal axis, 
and with a 9-fold repeat pattern corresponding to the 6-fold repeat 
of the trioxymethylene. All that has happened, quite clearly, is an 
interchange of homopolar bonds proceeding in a ‘‘ zip ” fashion, 
made possible by the previous apposition of the appropriate mole- 
cules of the ring polymeride by crystal forces. In this way the 
crystals of ring polymerides autocatalyse their transformation to 
chain polymerides. This mechanism may prove of very general 
application. The apposition of chain polymeride molecules neces- 
sary to form fibres may be produced by flow and shear, as has been 
very beautifully shown by W. H. Carothers and J. W. Hill74 for

poly-esters. A thread of glassy poly-ester is instantaneously con- 
verted by strain into an oriented fibre. 
Of carbohydrate polymerides, the literature on cellulose is too 
voluminous even to be referred to, but some understanding of the 
mechanism of cellulose formation in Nature has been derived by the 
study of the cell walls of single cells of the alga Valonia ~entricosa,'~ 
which have been shown to consist of a double spiral network of 
cellulose chains intersecting nearrly at right angles to give a " multi- 
ply " structure of maximum strength. This is probably the case 
in all vegetable cell walls, save that in elongated fibre cells the angle 
is reduced to a few degrees. In wood, K. Preudenberg 76 has shown 
that the cellulose network is reinforced by interstitial lignin. 
The starches have been much studied, particularly by J. R. Katz 77 
and his co-workers. The difference between starch and cellulose 
is due to the steric inability of the former, derived from a-glucose, 
to build straight chains leading to a nearly amorphous structure. 
The most generally significant advance, however, is in our under- 
standing of the essential nature and classification of proteins. 
W. T. Astbury has now shown that the protein, besides its character- 
istic peptide chain which can exist in the a-(contracted) or 
p-(expanded) form, has also a characteristic thickness and width. 
The thickness 4.65 8. between NH and CO in neighbouring chains 
is roughly the same for all proteins, but the width corresponds to 
bonding between the side chains, and consequently varies with their 
length, being only 4.5-6.1 A. in silk fibrin,78 and up to 9.8 A. in 
keratin. Further, the side chains can remain unattached, as in the 
soluble proteins like ~valburnen,~~ can be attached by ionic linkages 
in the gelatinsYs0 myosin, and muscle,s1 or by permanent peptide

or -S-S- linkages in the sclero-proteins such as keratinF2 giving 
rise to a semi-rigid ladder-like structure. The extremely complex 
physical properties of the proteins, particularly their behaviour on 
swelling with water 84 or adsorption on have already 
been- qualitatively analysed by this model. Here we have un- 
doubtedly the key to the mechanism of movement, if not to the very 
existence, of living matter. 
After the proteins, the lipoids are of the greatest biological interest. 
Here we find liquid-crystal structures playing an important de, as 
emphasised by F. This is particularly the case in nerve:’ 
which has been studied by X-rays in active, narcotised, and de- 
generate states. Thus the applications of X-ray technique are 
already passing the boundary of biochemistry into physiology and 
pathology. 
Liquids and Classes. 
The methods of X-ray analysis of liquids and amorphous solids 
developed by Debye and Prim (see Ann. Reports, 1929, 26, 306) 
have been the basis for an extensive study of types of liquid struc- 
ture. The two characteristics of a liquid are (a) the close contact 
between the molecules, leading to a relatively dense approximately 
close-packed structure ; (b) the irregular nature of the packing over 
distances more than a few molecular diameters. Both these 
characters are modified by the temperature and the nature of the 
molecules. Higher temperatures produce rotary and translatory 
molecular movements, but molecular clustering still occurs up to 
and even slightly above the critical point, as shown by the work of 
F. H. W. No11 88 on ether. The effect of the nature of the molecules 
is more varied. X-Ray analysis distinguishes between small-angle 
diffraction due to intermolecular, and large-angle diffraction due to 
intramolecular, interference. Further, the small-angle diffraction 
is either normal, indicating close packing, or abnormal, indicating a 
looser arrangement of molecules, generally brought about by dipole 
attractions. The analysis of these offers greater difficulty as it can

on1.y be done indirectly by assuming a mean molecular distribution, 
and calculating the diffraction to compare with that observed. It 
has, however, been attempted in one case, that of where the 
basic arrangement is tetrahedral (quartz-like) rather than close- 
packed. 
Greater anisotropy of molecules leads to clumping in parallel 
aggregates, as occurs in nematic liquid crystals which show when 
oriented a fibre diagram. Finally they may arrange themselves in 
layers, generally curved, as in smectic liquid crystals which show one 
set of crystal plane refiexions. (Between these and true crystals are 
still other intermediate stages; see below.) The general scheme is 
shown below: 
1. Atomic liquids : Hg, Na, K, Rb, 
2. Close-packed molecular liquids :  GEL,.^^ CCl,,Ql C,H,Cl,,g3 (C2H6)20,88 S,. 
3. Associated molecular liquids : Hg0,93 C,H,,.0H.94 
4. Nematic liquids.96 
5. Smectic liquids : thallium st,earntr.SG 
The precise intimate structure of liquids is still in dispute. 
According to G. W. Stewart,g7 a liquid consists of a mass of small 
quasi-crystallites, the so-called cybotactic groups , containing 10- 
100 molecules, not necessarily permanent, and separated by a number 
of unattached molecules. Another view 98 contends that these 
aggregates have only a statistical and not a physical existence, and 
that every molecule in the liquid is immediately surrounded by the 
same quasi-regular arrangement of molecules. 
We have no space to discuss the great developments of the past 
two years in the study of liquid crystals (see Ann. Reports, 1931, 28, 
280). Luckily the whole subject is amply covered by the Faraday 
Society’s volume “ Liquid Crystals and Anisotropic RTelts.” 99 
The most important facts that have emerged are the clear dis- 
tinction between nematic liquids where neighbouriiig molecules are 
merely oriented in parallel, and smectic liquids where they are also 
arranged in regular planes, inside of which they either form a two-

dimensional liquid (true smectic) or are arranged in lattices (crystal- 
line smectic), which are still free to move over each other. The 
urious fo cal conic structures exhibited by smectic crystals have 
been shown by (Sir) W. H. Bragg to be an equilibrium structure 
for molecular layers lacking rigidity. 
Glasses have plainly the same internal molecular structure as 
liquids : they differ by their relative immobility, with the consequent 
appearance of rigidity, or more correctly, of a long characteristic 
time for plastic flow. (Liquids also have an internal rigidity, as 
shown by B. V. Deriagin,2 but the characteristic time is short.) 
Therniodyrmrnically, glasses differ from undercooled liquids by the 
absence of internal equilibrium, as discussed by I?. Simon: E. 
Berger,4 and G. Tarnm~~nn.~ The liquid-glass transformation is not 
sharp, but inside a small temperature range the slope of various 
property-temperature curves changes markedly. Gels are diphasic 
systems, one of which is generally a glass, though sometimes 
crystalline .6 
W. H. Zachnriasen7 has discussed the conditions under which 
glasses are formed, equating them with the possibility of forming 
three-dimensional frameworks. This, in the case of ionic glasses, 
occurs when, in thc notation of p. 407, b/n 2 z/2, e.g., for boric 
anhydride, silica, tungsten trioxide, beryllium fluoride. Glasses 
may also be expected where metallic and homopolar structures have 
approximately the same energy, e.g., for selenium and arsenic. 
The actual atomic arrangements in vitreous silica have been 
determined by B. Warren; it is simply a completely irregular 
three-dimensional network of SiO, tetrahedra sharing oxygens. 
Other glasses have also been studied by  x-ray^.^ 
The utilisatjon of electronic and protonic waves for crystal, liquid, 
and molecular analysis has grown into too large a subject to be 
discussed in this report (see Ann. Reports, 1929, 26, 284). The main 
methods and results, however, have been described in W. I,. Bragg’s
