TheMolecular Weight ofCinobufagin
ByDorothy Crowfoot and H.Jensen
Ithas been suggested1 that cinobufagin (C2s-
H320e) canbeconsidered astheacetyl derivative
ofanunsaturated hydroxylactone, C23H30O6, and
apparently isclosely related chemically tocertain
plant aglucones which are also C23derivatives.1
The x-ray crystallographic examination ofthis
principle byCrowfoot2 hasgiven values, however,
which donot agree with theproposed formula
C25H32Oe andwhich indicate that thecompound
probably contains twenty-six carbon atoms.
Inorder tocheck these results, x-ray measure-
ments have now been made ontwoderivatives of
cinobufagin, namely, acetylcinobufagin and cino-
bufagone. The measurements obtained onthese
compounds provide two independent determina-
tions ofthemolecular weight ofcinobufagin and
both more nearly agree with theformulas derived
from C26. Thus themolecular weight ofacetyl-
cinobufaginwasfound tobe487=*=10,thecalcu-
lated values fortheacetyl derivatives ofC26H34O6
and C25H320b being, respectively, 484 and 470.
Cinobufagone has amolecular weight of443=*=10
which isinagreement with theformula C26H32O6,
440, and not C^HsoOe, 426. Details ofthecrys-
tallographic measurements aregiven below.
The analytical values previously reported for
cinobufagin and certain ofitsderivatives3 agree
with theformula C26H340e. This new formula
would bring cinobufagin into very close relation-
ship tobufotalin (present inthesecretion ofBufo
vulgaris) towhich Wieland and co-workers4
assigned theformula C26H360e and which they
showed canbeconsidered asanacetyl derivative
of anunsaturated hydroxylactone (C24H34O5).
Itmight bementioned, inconnection with this,

animal cardiac principles indicate that their
physiological properties show more resemblance
tothephysiological action ofscillaridin than of
other plant aglucones. Chemical researches by
Stoll and co-workers6 have shown that scillaridin
isaC24derivative, while most other plant aglu-
cones have been found tobe C23derivatives.
The investigation ofWieland and co-workers4 on
bufotalin indicates that thelactone ring inthe
animal cardiac principles isasix-membered ring
probably similar tothat found byStoll and co-
workers6 forscillaridin. Inview ofourfindings
onthemolecular weight ofcinobufagin, itappears
that arenobufagin and regularobufaginare also
probably C24rather than C23derivatives asorigi-
nally suggested byJensen.7 Further research on
the exact chemical composition ofthese two
principles hasbeen undertaken inorder toanswer
thisquestion.
Itshould beadded that thecrystallographic
examination ofcinobufagone and acetylcino-
bufagin alone would notexclude molecular weights
oftwice themagnitude deduced since theasym-
metric unit ineach case contains two C2emole-
cules. This possibility, however, isexcluded by
theoriginal measurements oncinobufagin itself
inwhich thesingle molecule istheasymmetric
unit.
The actual crystal structures indicated bythe
measurements forcinobufagin, acetylcinobufagin
andcinobufagone donot seem tobear very simple
relation tooneanother ortothose ofanyofthe
compounds inthecardiac aglucone series sofar
examined. This isnotsurprising since theintro-
duction ofmany hydroxyl groups isknown to
produce considerable variation inthecrystallo-

Summary
The determinations ofmolecular weights of
cinobufagin and two ofitsderivatives, acetyl-
cinobufagin andcinobufagone, indicate that cino-
bufagin has the composition CseHgiOg. The
analytical data previously reported forcinobufa-
ginandcertain ofitsderivatives agree with this
new formula.

The Formation ofCyclic Azo Compounds from 2,2'-Diaminodiphenyls
ByR.B.Sandin and T.L.Cairns
The compound 4,4'-diarsonodiphenyl1,2has
been prepared from benzidine, according tothe
method ofBart. Inanattempt toprepare the
isomeric 2,2'-diarsonodiphenyl byananalogous
procedure, theauthors ofthis paper have found
that when tetrazotized 2,2'-diaminodiphenyl is
treated with arsenious oxide insodium carbonate
solution, aconsiderable part ofthetetrazotized
compound isconverted into o,o'-azodiphenyl.3
Theauthors believe ittobeageneral reaction. It
isalso believed that thearsenite functions asa
reducing agent instead ofproceeding according to
thetypical Bart reaction.
The proposed equation forthisreaction is

better tocall phenazone oro-diphenyleneazone, cyclic o,o-azodi-
