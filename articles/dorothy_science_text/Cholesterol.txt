X-RAY CRYSTALLOGRAPHY AND THE CHEMISTRY 
OF THE STEROIDS. PART I 
By J. D. BERNAL, F.R.S., DOROTHY CROWFOOT 
AND I. FANKUCHEN 
(Received 5 July 1939-Revised 17 April 1940) 
A survey has been made of the X-ray crystallography of some eighty sterol derivatives 
belonging mainly to the cholesterol and ergosterol series but including also calciferol and 
other photoderivatives of ergosterol and some higher plant and animal sterols. The measure- 
ments are recorded in four tables and include determinations of unit cell size, space group and 
some data on the crystal morphology and optics. In three cases, cholesteryl chloride, bromide 
and cholesteryl chloride hydrochloride, Patterson projections have also been derived from the 
intensities of the X-ray reflexions of the hOl planes. These confirm earlier deductions on the 
shape and size of the sterol molecules, proving that these are roughly lath-shaped, 20 x 7 x 4 A, 
and the details of the patterns can also to some degree be correlated with the actual arrange- 
ment of the carbon atoms in the sterol ring system and with the positions of the chlorine and 
bromine atoms. The arrangement of the molecules in the crystal units is closely that given 
by the preliminary examination from the optic orientation, and this has therefore been 
employed to suggest in each of the remaining sterol crystal structures the probable molecular 
arrangement. 
Among the eighty compounds studied a number of different types of crystal structure 
appear. An attempt is made to group these in a general geometric classification depending 
upon the relative orientation of the molecular axes, thickness, width, and length to the 
crystallographic axes a, b, and c. In monoclinic crystals three main groups are distinguished 
in which the monoclinic b axis is the direction of the molecular thickness, width or length, 
and the orthorhombic and triclinic crystals are classified by comparison with the monoclinic 
varieties. Inside each group divisions are based first on the multiplicities, the numbers of 
molecules present, and secondly on the space groups. Altogether 105 different sterol structures 
are included in the classification, and of these seventy-seven fall into the second of the three 
main groups described above, which includes cholesteryl chloride and bromide and has been 
called the normal type of sterol structure. 
The crystallographic measurements as a whole are discussed in their bearing on specific 
chemical problems under the following headings: 
(a) Characterization and identification 
The X-ray data have been applied particularly among the higher plant and animal sterols 
both to identify individual constituents (e.g. stigmasterol in phytosterol mixtures), to dis- 
tinguish additional crystal forms (e.g. two types of cerevisterol) and to characterize new sterols 
and relate these to previously known compounds (e.g. a sterol from rubber). 
(b) Molecular weight determinations 
Molecular weight measurements have been carried out on cholestenone, ergotetraene, 
y-spinastenol acetate, ergosterol H20, stigmasterol H20, y-sitosterol H20 and , sitosterol from 
rubber. In the case of crystals of cholestanol, 8-ergostadienetriol and Z-4-cholestene-7-ol, 
the measurements are used to estimate water of crystallization.

(c) The stereochemistry of the carbon skeleton 
The X-ray measurements indicate that the general configuration of the sterol ring system 
must be flat, but so far it has been impossible to correlate stereochemical changes at particular 
ring junctions with crystallographic changes, e.g. between rings C and D (c-ergostenol, 
,f-ergostenol), B and C (lumisterol), and A and B (coprostane, cholestane). 
(d) The effect of substituents on the crystallography of the sterols 
(i) The position of the hydroxyl group. A hydroxyl group at C 3 of the sterol skeleton generally, 
but not invariably, leads to double-layer formation in the crystal structure and vice versa, 
a double-layer crystal structure usually indicates the presence of a terminal hydroxyl group. 
Exceptions are cholestane 6-ol which shows a double layer, and pyrocalciferol which does 
not. Brassicasterol, cerevisterol, and the spinasterols all probably have hydroxyl groups 
at C 3. The position of i-cholesterol (which shows no double layer) is obscure. 
(ii) The stereochemistry of the hydroxyl group at C 3. It is not possible to distinguish at this stage 
between the two possible configurations of the hydroxyl group at C 3. In cholesteryl chloride 
and bromide, the chlorine and bromine atoms must lie closely in the plane of the ring system. 
ac-Chlor-cholestane is correlated crystallographically with cholesteryl chloride. 
(iii) The position of the double bonds. The introduction of either hydroxyl groups or halogens 
at the double-bond system usually produces radical changes in the crystallography which 
makes simple comparison difficult. The Patterson analysis of cholesteryl chloride hydro- 
chloride provides, however, definite evidence that the extra chlorine atom is at C 5. The 
crystallography of both the hydroxyl and maleic anhydride derivatives of ergosterol is in 
agreement with their present chemical formulae but provides no certain proof of the 
correctness of these. 
(e) A comparison of the crystallography of different sterols-monohydroxy compounds 
There is a group of sterols, including ergosterol and many of the higher plant and animal 
sterols, which show particularly close resemblances in crystal structure to one another. While 
inclusion in this group must indicate close similarity both in sterol skeleton and molecular 
arrangement, deviations do not necessarily seem to have a chemical significance. 
(f) The structure of calciferol 
Calciferol, while showing certain differences from the characteristic sterol group mentioned 
above, also shows similarities, particularly in c-plane intensities. It seems unlikely therefore 
that the actual distribution of the atoms in the molecule differs considerably from that in 
ergosterol. 
Conclusion 
Many of the outstanding problems of the chemical structure of the sterols can only be 
settled by exact analysis. The present survey has indicated a number of compounds that 
are suitable for such treatment. 
The use of X-ray crystallography for the solution of problems of the structure of 
chemical molecules is ortly beginning, but it has already shown itself as a promising 
method of attack. X-ray analysis of any crystalline material can yield, according to 
the degree to which it is pushed, a succession of data bearing in greater and greater 
detail on the structure of the material. Briefly, the successive stages of analysis can 
yield information on: I, Identification and comparison of substances from different 
sources; II, Molecular weight to any desired degree of accuracy; III, Symmetry of

molecules; IV, General size and shape of molecules; V, Position of substituent groups; 
VI, Position of all the atoms in the molecules (Crowfoot and Bernal I937; Robertson 
I937). The first three stages are straightforward and unequivocal, the next two are 
less direct and usually require a degree of collaboration between crystallographic and 
chemical methods. The last stage is the most exact and can, though as yet only under 
certain conditions, give information absolutely independent of chemical considera- 
tions. It is, however, extremely laborious and limited as yet to fairly simple compounds. 
The investigations recorded in this paper have not been carried to this last stage. 
Their aim has been to use the methods of crystallography as an auxiliary in deter- 
mining the structural formula of an important group of naturally occurring chemical 
substances, the steroids. In this field up to a few years ago chemical methods had not 
seemed to yield unequivocal results. Here an early application of crystallographic 
methods by one of us (Bernal 1932) gave the clue to a fundamental revision of the 
structural formula of the carbon skeleton of cholesterol, I (Windaus I928; Wieland 
I928) and led to the proposal of that associated with the names of Rosenheim and King 
(I932) and Wieland and Dane (I932), II, and now generally accepted. The crystal 
structures studied at that time also suggested that in cholesterol and ergosterol the 
hydroxyl group was in a terminal position, and that in the sex hormone, oestrone, the 
active groups were at opposite ends of the molecule.

Both these deductions have been supported by later chemical work, but in view of 
the simplicity of the crystallographic methods employed in reaching them, more 
confirmation would be desirable. Naturally no complete test will be possible without 
either a chemical synthesis on the one hand or an exact crystallographic analysis on 
the other-both of which are now within the bounds of possibility. In the meantime, 
it has been possible to add to the weight of evidence by extending the method of 
preliminary crystallographic examination and comparison to a larger number of sterols 
and their derivatives. We feel it is useful to present now the results so far obtained, 
to discuss the conclusions of different degrees of probability that may be drawn from 
them, and to suggest the lines of further attack on the most outstanding problems in 
this field.

138 J. D. BERNAL, D. CROWFOOT AND I. FANKUCHEN ON X-RAY 
The present investigation arose directly out of the original examination of chole- 
sterol, ergosterol and calciferol in 1932, and has been carried on parallel with much 
of the chemical work of the last eight years. The material to be considered is concerned 
with some eighty compounds belonging to the main sterol series and including 
cholesterol, ergosterol and some of the higher plant and animal sterols, but the actual 
derivatives studied are chemically a somewhat haphazard collection. For purposes of 
reference the crystallographic data are listed in four tables: 1, The cholesterol series; 
2, The ergosterol series; 3, The photoderivatives of ergosterol; 4, Higher plant 
and animal steroids; and each group is further subdivided according to the chemical 
character of the available compounds, hydrocarbons, hydroxyl and halogen derivatives 
and so on. 
The information given in tables 1-4 covers the first stages only of the crystallographic 
investigation, determination of cell size, space group and some data on the crystal 
optics and morphology. The details of most of the actual measurements carried out, 
together with estimated intensities of some of the X-ray reflexions, are recorded in a 
thesis by one of us (Crowfoot 1936). It is possible to make direct use of these data for 
the identification of individual sterol derivatives, and though in most cases the cell 
constants are not given correct to more than 1 or 2 %, in a few examples (see table 6) 
they were measured with sufficient precision to be employed for molecular weight 
determination. Apart from the recognition of molecular symmetry, which is not 
important here since all sterol molecules are asymmetric, the further use of the data 
depends upon how much correlation can be effected between crystallographic character 
and chemical structure. Some of the crystal structures listed, such as those of anhydrous 
ergosterol, of cholesterol and of coprostanol, are obviously very complicated and can 
hardly be expected to yield much chemical information. Others are comparatively 
simple and would probably repay an attempt at intensive analysis. Short of this it is 
possible, as shown in the first sterol investigation, to derive the most probable arrange- 
ment of the molecules and their approximate dimensions from a combination of the 
optic with the X-ray data; and this is the method that has been followed with all the 
sterol crystals now examined. In order to facilitate comparison between different 
compounds the nomenclature of the crystallographic axes in tables 1-4 is arranged 
as far as possible to coincide with that of the optic axes, a, o; b, f; c, y; most of the 
crystals examined are plates showing one dominating face, the c plane. Deviations in 
crystal character which make such a nomenclature impossible or undesirable then 
provide one type of distinction that will be important in further crystallographic 
classification. But in view of the assumption as to the character of the molecules which 
underlies such a process it is worth while first to review shortly some direct evidence 
which has been obtained in the course of the investigations in support of the original 
deductions of the size and shape of sterol molecules.

CRYSTALLOGRAPHY AND THE CHEMISTRY OF STEROIDS 139 
1. THE DIMENSIONS AND ORIENTATION OF STEROL MOLECULES IN CRYSTALS 
It is worth considering first how far the data now collected add to the certainty with 
which the dimensions of the sterol molecule are known. The smallest unit-cell dimen- 
sion actually measured on any of the crystals so far examined is 5-85 A in cis-J-5-6- 
cholestene-3-4-diol (b), and this proves definitely that in one direction the molecule 
is at least as small as 5X85 A. This can be combined with the evidence of the crystal 
cell of ,8-ergostadienetriol (leaflet) to prove that in another direction the molecule 
must not be shorter than 15 A, while the long unit-cell dimensions measured in 
dibromocholesteryl chloride and in i-cholesteryl ethyl ether suggest that the sterol 
molecule can assume a configuration in which it is at least 21 A long. 
The unit-cell dimensions alone do not take the determination very far. But a 
further direct test is possible through a more detailed examination of cholesteryl 
chloride and bromide, including an application of Patterson analysis. A preliminary 
account of the crystallography of these two compounds has already appeared (Bernal 
and Crowfoot I933). They both crystallize in a simple monoclinic arrangement with 
only two molecules in the unit cell related to one another by a twofold screw axis. 
Intensity data on the (hol) planes were derived from Weissenberg photographs taken 
with the crystals rotating about the b axes, and from the F2 values calculated Patterson 
series were formed. The diagrams obtained (figure 1 B, C) show two irregular series of 
maxima running along the lines x 0 and x= - and corresponding to two main sets 
of interatomic distances. One of these is between atoms in the same molecule, which, 
if they lie almost directly along the c axis would, with varying distances between atoms 
in the c direction, have a common a interatomic distance of about zero. The second 
corresponds to distances between the two molecules, where again with varying distances 
towards c the a difference is approximately 1. The break-up of the field into these two 
ridges at x=0 and x= 1 can only be explained by the presence of long molecules 
relatively thin in the a direction, molecules which agree well both in character and 
dimensions with the requirements of the present sterol formula. This is illustrated by 
figure 1 A, which shows a projection of two cholesteryl bromide molecules placed in 
the unit cell as required by the Patterson projection. The drawings are made assuming 
a puckered arrangement of the carbon atoms in the sterol ring system, with ring 
junctions trans throughout, and some even of the more intimate features of this structure 
can be correlated with the X-ray data. The main ridge in the Patterson diagram at 
x= 0 is composed of a series of peaks at approximately 2 2, 4'4 and 6 6 A from the 
origin, and these distances correspond closely with those between carbon atoms 
concentrated around the junctions between the rings of the sterol skeleton. And the 
peak heights are probably further enhanced by their coincidence with the main 
carbon-halogen distances (cf. Robertson I939a). It is not possible to fix the stero- 
chemistry of the side chain at this stage, but it is obvious that it must continue the 
main line of the ring system, and the same is true of the bromine and chlorine atoms.

(2) Morphology. The crystals are classified first according to habit, e.g. as plates, prisms, needles, 
laths (platy crystals markedly elongated in one direction), and this description is followed by a zone 
symbol to show direction of elongation, if any, e.g. [010], and then a form symbol, e.g. {001}, to indicate 
the dominating face. Any other forms observed are then noted. Very commonly these were only 
measured as edges bounding the main face and the indexing is then recorded in an incomplete form, 
e.g. {101}. 
(3) Optics. The crystals were all biaxial. The sign of the birefringence is first recorded followed by 
the directions of the principal refractive indices with reference to the crystal axes. In some cases the 
optic axial angle was measured by immersion in glycerine and this is then recorded as 2 V. 
(4) Structure type. This column refers to the crystallographic classification of table 5.

originally derived for quite different sterol crystals (Bernal I--3). The principal

remaining inaccuracy in this description is probably due to the indeterminacy of the 
exact slope of the plane of the ring system to the b plane. But preliminary calculations 
on intensities suggest this slope to be about 20-25?, which does not greatly affect the 
rough estimate of molecular size and shape. 
In any one crystal structure the molecular dimensions deduced from the combined 
cell dimensions and optic orientation will not necessarily present the rigid picture 
suggested above owing to the packing of the individual atoms in the actual molecular 
arrangement adopted. It does seem true, however, that no very grave changes in the 
molecular configuration as a whole-such as the curling up of the side chain, for 
example-do occur in the course of crystallization. In all the sterol crystal structures 
examined so far it has been found possible, using as guide the optic orientation, to fit 
molecules corresponding in outline with those required by the present chemical 
formula. And, for the purposes of a discussion of the varieties of crystal structure found, 
it is a great advantage to picture the sterol molecule as constructed approximately on 
rectangular. co-ordinates, having a definite length, width and thickness. The variation 
of crystal structures found can then be expressed by the changing orientation of the 
molecular axes to the crystal axes and the combination of these orientations within 
the crystallographic space groups. 
2. AN ATTEMPT AT A CLASSIFICATION OF STEROL CRYSTAL STRUCTURES 
To assist in tracing the chemical implications of the different crystal structures 
actually observed it is essential to bring these into some kind of geometrical classifica- 
tion. One type may be based on the relation between the crystallographic axes and 
symmetry and the orientations of the sterol molecules treated simply as lath-shaped 
objects, groups within the classification being described by a nomenclature indicating 
directly the relation of the molecular axes, thickness, width and length, to the crystal 
axes a, b, and c. Such a classification may evidently be extended to lath-shaped 
molecules in general, though any scheme suggested now cannot avoid being somewhat 
arbitrary; partly because the relations between the different variables are not exactly 
known and, in any case, need several dimensions in which to express them, and partly 
because intermediate structure types may exist which are not shown by our limited 
experimental evidence. Certain relations between the directions of the crystallo- 
graphic axes and the probable molecular orientation do, however, seem to be par- 
ticularly common among the actual structures observed, and these have therefore been 
chosen as a basis for the crystallographic classification. 
The most usual type of sterol crystal among all those examined is still that first 
described by Bernal, which we have come to speak of as the 'normal' type. These 
crystals are monoclinic plates tending to be elongated along the b axis which is the 
direction of the /, refractive index, y being inclined at varying angles to the plane of 
the plate (001). A study of the unit-cell dimensions of this type of crystal shows that

150 J. D. BERNAL, D. CROWFOOT AND I. FANKUCHEN ON X-RAY 
these are roughly multiples of 41 A, the molecular thickness, a sin fi; 7 A, the width b; 
and 20 A, -the length c. Crystals showing these characteristics can therefore be classified 
as belonging to a class by themselves, which has as unit-cell dimensions a sin /- n1 
x thickness, b nw x width, c n1 x length (figure 2). For purposes of classification the 
orientation of the molecular axes, thickness, width and length (taken in this order) 
can then be described by the symbols abc (also in order), and these symbols followed 
by numerals ntnwn1 to represent the multiplicities. For example, the symbol abc 214 
indicates a crystal structure in which, roughly, a sin /, is a measure of twice the 
molecular thickness, b of the width, and c of four times the length. For convenience 
the symbol may be shortened to a 214. It will be realized that the product of the 
figures gives the number of molecules in the unit cell. 
Opposed to this, the a class is a much smaller group of monoclinic crystals in 
which the symmetry axis is more nearly some multiple of 5 A and optically coincides 
with the direction of the a refractive index. Here the symmetry axis, b, evidently 
corresponds in direction more nearly with the molecular thickness and this may be 
considered the distinguishing character of a second type, the 'reversed' or b type for 
which the molecular dimensions are roughly given by thickness b/n,, width a sin fll/n, 
and length c/n, (figure 3). The symbol for classification is therefore bac, n n n1 or 
shortly b, nznwnl. 
As might be expected there does seem to be a gradual transition between these two 
groups, and a third small division appears of crystal structures which it is very difficult 
to classify as either one or the other. These have been separated into a group by them- 
selves, ab or crossed. The length of the molecules is still along the c direction, but the 
plane of the ring system is probably nearly at 450 to the a and b axes (figure 4). The 
group symbol becomes ab. c (n1 x nj) . nj. It is possible for n, x n" to be compounded 
in different ways, a and b being either roughly equal to one another or one of them 
some multiple of the other. This can be indicated by splitting the figures within the 
bracket-e.g. ab(22) 1 and ab(41) 1 are two possible varieties in each of which a x b is 
equal to 4 x molecular width x thickness. But in the first case a and b are roughly 
equal, in the second a is four times b. 
The third variety of crystal structure which is geometrically compatible with 
monoclinic symmetry is that in which the molecular length is mainly along the b axis. 
Only one sterol derivative, cholestene, shows this orientation (with the possible very 
doubtful exception of coprostanol which is omitted from the scheme), but it is known 
in several compounds of the oestrin series (figure 5). If the nomenclature of the 
crystal axes is arranged so that the directions of the molecular thickness, width and 
length are given by the axes c, a, b respectively, the group symbol becomes cab, 
shortened to c, n n n1 
Any attempt to include the orthorhombic or triclinic crystal structures in the above 
classification must to a certain degree be arbitrary, since in the orthorhombic system 
all three crystallographic axes are symmetry axes, in the triclinic none, and it is a

matter of choice as to which unit-cell dimension is named a, b or c. But the relation 
of certain orthorhombic and triclinic crystal structures to each of the above groups is 
very marked, and the attempt has therefore been made to introduce these into the 
classification following particularly the secondary consideration of crystal habit as a

guide. In the a type structures, the crystals are markedly elongated in the b direction 
(width, O6), in the b type also b (here the direction of the thickness, a) is the needle 
axis. Orthorhombic or triclinic crystals showing elongation in the apparent direction 
of the width are therefore classified as a type, in the direc- 
tion of the thickness, b type. The optic orientation in these 
crystals is often anomalous owing to the really consider- 
able deviation of the molecular axes from the crystal axes. 
The ab or crossed type is accepted on the near equality of 
the a and b dimensions. 
Inside each main division, a, b, ab and c, further sub- 
division is based first on the varying multiplicities of n and 
secondly on the space groups shown. Within each space 
group the structures are arranged approximately in order 
of increasing molecular slope to the c plane, so that hori- 
zontal relationships between compounds showing nearly 
equal angles of slope can easily be traced. Purposely, no 
formal numbering of the structure types is set out, since the 
varieties already discovered certainly do not exhaust the 
crystallographic possibilities. The symbols themselves fall 
into a reasonable sequence into which new structures can 
be inserted when found without disturbance of the general 
order. 
The result of this classification is table 5. This includes not 
only the crystal structures listed in tables 1-4 but also for 
completeness a few whose measurements have been re- 
corded elsewhere, particularly the compounds studied by 
Schulze, a group mainly of i-cholesterol derivatives 
measured by Miss F. Bell, and certain of the sex hor- 
mones. 
There are in all 105 different crystal structures listed in 
table 5 and of these seventy-eight fall into the a group or 
normal type which is some justification for the adoption 
of this title. Of the three remaining groups, nine structures 
are listed under b (reversed), fourteen under ab (crossed), 
and four under c. Within the b, ab and c series there are 
almost as many subdivisions as crystal structures named. 
But these subdivisions are worth stating since each repre- 
sents a distinct type of structure which can be related to 
one or other of the subdivisions of the normal series. A

of all listed. Apart from androsterone, the lactone from 
digoxigenin and cholestane-5-ol-3-6-dione, it includes only 
compounds such as ethers, esters and halogen and keto de- 
rivatives, in none of which are there any hydroxyl groups. 
The length of b is fairly constant at 7 6-7 9 A; the plane of 
the ring system is approximately in the a plane, a sin /? 
corresponding to twice the molecular thickness. The slope of 
the long axes of the molecules to the c plane is generally pro- 
nounced, varying from about 127 to 1350. (There are devi- 
ations at either end of the series.) This molecular arrange- 
ment (figure 2) can be considered as a fundamental from 
which a great many of the others described here are built up, 
in fact, all the remaining normal type structures. Its relation 
to the type of ergotetraene (b 211) (figure 3) in which the a 
and b axes are interchanged is obvious from the nomenclature. 
But A-4-cholestene-7-ol, ab (21)1 (figure 4), can also be very 
closely derived from it by a gradual tilting of the plane of the 
ring system to the b plane. 
The structure type a 212 (thirty-six compounds) is essenti- 
ally the same as a 211 and can be considered to be built up 
of two units of this placed end to end in the c direction. This 
can be achieved in two ways to give monoclinic and ortho- 
rhombic symmetry respectively and the significance of these 
two divisions is rather different. In the main monoclinic 
series-seventeen compounds belonging to the space groups 
P 21, and, for convenience, P 1, the doubling of c doubles the 
asymmetric unit and suggests that the molecules are united 
end to end by hydroxyl bonds (figure 6). In the ortho- 
rhombic group the asymmetric unit is the molecule itself 
and, while it is possible for association to occur in the space 
group P22121, this is not so in P212121. Chemically both 
orthorhombic groups are rather mixed, while the monoclinic 
section includes almost exclusively compounds with terminal 
hydroxyl groups. The space groups C 2 and A 2 fall rather 
into the P 22121 category. 
The relation between the a 211 structures and that of 
A-4-cholestene-7-ol, ab (21)1 may be paralleled by one be- 
tween the a 212 structures and those of, say, oa-ergostenol and 
ergosterol peroxide, ab (21)2. It is one of the drawbacks of 
the classification as it stands that the groups a, ab and b 
necessarily merge into one another-so that it is doubtful, A L J 7 i m

for example, whether ox-ergostene and coprostene dibromide should be classified 
as a 212 or ab (21)2, and /-ergostadienetriol II as a 412 or ab (41)2. Such relations 
are more easily indicated by a use of the multiplicities alone as the basis of classi- 
fication. But against this use it is, on the one hand, very convenient for experi- 
mental purposes to distinguish the main a, b and c groups, and, on the other hand, 
differences based only on multiplicities are often equally arbitrary in character. 
y-Sitosterol H20 is, for example, exceedingly similar crystallographically to ergosterol 
H20-the doubling of a which removes it from the a 21 group is evidently a very 
minor crystallographic variation shown only by a weak superstructure on the principal 
X-ray reflexions. The likeness to ergosterol is easily recognized in the tables by reference 
to the actual values of , and the cell dimensions. There are accordingly three principal 
directions in which geometrical comparisons may be made between the different 
crystal structures listed in the table. First, the division into a, b or c groups indicates 
roughly the orientation of the molecular axes to the crystallographic axes. Secondly, 
within a single multiplicity group the change from a to ab to b indicates a gradual 
alteration in the slope of the short axes of the molecules to the a and b axes. Thirdly, 
the change in fi and c sin /, shows approximately the change in the relative slope of 
the long axes of the molecules to the c plane. 
The chief difficulty we have to contend with throughout is that though in the 
classification we have suggested that the molecules are oriented in certain crystallo- 
graphic directions-it is actually very seldom if ever that the molecular and crystallo- 
graphic axes exactly coincide (cf. Hendricks I934). There are only two or three crystal 
structures of all those examined in which a single X-ray reflexion seems to be of a 
different order of magnitude from all the others observed. Among these are x-ergo- 
stadienetriol and ergosterol peroxide and possibly suprasterol I, and here it is probable 
that the plane of the ring system coincides fairly accurately with the a plane. In all 
other cases we are dealing with various degrees of approximation to a parallel 
orientation. 
3. CHEMICAL IMPLICATIONS OF THE CRYSTALLOGRAPHIC INVESTIGATION 
(a) Characterization and identification 
Physical measurements may be employed in the routine examination of an unknown 
substance, first to characterize it as belonging to some established chemical series, and 
finally to identify it as a particular compound known through previous examination 
or synthesis. These uses depend on rather different characteristics of the data concerned, 
the first on the existence of certain similarities within particular chemical series, the 
second on detailed differences. 
The general classification of sterol crystals given in table 5 includes a great variety 
of types of crystal structure. Some of these are very individual in character, and if 
found in an unknown compound could not be considered necessarily suggestive of

sterol structure. But there is, in general, considerable similarity which extends between 
the different sterol series. The lines in the tabulation do not divide the cholesterol, 
ergosterol and phytosterol groups. In some of the structure types, particularly a 212 
and to a lesser degree a 211, crystal structures of such similarity are found that it 
would be difficult not to conclude that the chemical compounds present were in all 
cases closely related. 
This general similarity of many sterol crystal structures has had its disadvantages 
in the past in the difficulty with which compounds can be isolated pure and their 
chemical individuality established. Crystals belonging to the a 211 and a 212 groups 
commonly appear as lath-shaped plates bounded only by the edges (100), (110) and 
(010), and since a and b have almost the same sizes in all these compounds, morpho- 
logical crystallographic measurements are of little or no assistance in the identification 
of the substance present. It can be safely stated that the sterol crystals that are easily 
recognizable by morphological examination are those which do not belong to the 
crystallographically defined normal type-such as hydrated cholesterol or cholestene 
hydrochloride. But the X-ray method introduces a very rapid and simple means of 
identification which can actually be applied most easily in just the group which is 
most difficult to characterize in other ways. The b axis is an easily recognizable 
crystallographically unique direction, and X-ray photographs taken over a small 
oscillation range starting with the X-ray beam parallel to this axis are consequently 
also unique. These photographs give the (hol) reflexions, both the positions and 
intensities of which are extremely sensitive to small changes in molecular structure 
and shifts in orientation. The identity or otherwise of two compounds is most easily 
recognized by direct comparison of photographs. In default of a set in each of the 
various laboratories studying sterol mixtures, measurements of the cell sizes and 
records of the intensities serve the purpose equally well if rather more laboriously. 
These processes of characterization and identification by the X-ray method may 
be illustrated by the work on the mixed sterols of rubber recorded in table 4. 
A crystalline material isolated by Dr K. C. Roberts from rubber and which was 
considered probably to be a terpene alcohol related to amyrin was submitted to X-ray 
examination. This showed the presence in the preparation of two compounds, one of 
which gave X-ray photographs identical with those of stigmasterol. The second and 
main constituent proved exceedingly similar to ergosterol, and even more so to a 
constituent measured by accident in one soya-bean mixed sitosterol preparation. 
The measurements recorded, combined with the form of the X-ray reflections 
observed, justified its characterisation as a sterol closely related to ergosterol, possibly 
a- or /I-sitosterol. Since this paper was first written, chemical work in Professor 
Heilbron's laboratories at Imperial College has shown that two of the constituents 
of the mixed sterols of rubber are fl-sitosterol and 24 25-dehydrostigmastanol 
(private communication from Dr K. C. Roberts).*

CRYSTALLOGRAPHY AND THE CHEMISTRY OF STEROIDS 159 
Another sterol preparation in which X-ray examination has shown the presence of 
two crystalline forms is that of cerevisterol-the two varieties are listed as cerevisterol 
I and II in table 4. But since neither of these is identical with any other sterol so far 
studied, it is not at this stage possible to say whether the difference between them is 
only crystallographic or chemical as well-though the latter seems most likely. 
It is probable that many of the preparations so far examined are not altogether pure, 
as such great similarity in crystallography frequently results in mixed crystal formation. 
This is comparatively easy to recognize where the pure compounds have previously 
been studied, but more difficult where the suspected preparation contains new 
derivatives. The comparison between y-sitostanol and the preparation of afl-sitostanol, 
for example (table 4), was undertaken to settle the question of the identity or otherwise 
of these compounds. The X-ray photographs are exceedingly similar, much more so 
than photographs so far studied of different individuals, and suggest that the main 
constituents of the two preparations are identical. But the fact that the two sets of 
photographs are not exactly the same indicates that there must be one or more different 
constituents in either or both samples. And one possible constituent is suggested by 
the fact that spinastanol also gives photographs practically identical with those of the 
sitostanols in the spacings, though markedly different from them in the intensities of 
the X-ray reflexions. Other similar examples of mixed crystals appear among the 
sitosterols themselves. in the soya-bean sitosterol preparation it is common to find 
some crystals which give X-ray reflexions very similar in position and intensities to 
y-sitosterol but not showing the superstructure which gives y-sitosterol a doubled 
a dimension, while others show a much weaker superstructure. Still it is noticeable 
that such mixed crystal formation seems only to occur when the crystal structures are 
very much alike not only in type but in the relative slope of the molecules. The same 
soya-bean sitosterol crystals give in addition weak reflexions of stigmasterol which forms 
layer growths over, and not included in, the sitosterol complex, owing presumably to 
the marked difference of slope of the molecules to the c plane in the two structures. 
It would obviously be valuable in applying the X-ray method for identification 
purposes in this field to examine first in more detail the crystallographic behaviour 
of sterol mixtures. Four possible varieties of crystallographic interaction between two 
compounds have already been observed: 
(i) The two components separate in two distinct crystals which can be recognized 
by optical or morphological means, e.g. stigmasterol and f-sitosterol. 
(ii) The two distinct crystal structures form layer structures recognizable on X-ray 
photographs, e.g. stigmasterol on the soya-bean sitosterol. 
(iii) A mixed crystal is formed, e.g. probably ax-, f- and y-sitosterols. Such crystals 
give rather blurred X-ray reflexions intermediate in character between those of the 
two components. 
(iv) A definite crystal compound is formed giving X-ray reflexions different in 
position and intensities from either component, e.g. calciferol-pyrocalciferol.

These four types of behaviour are not sharply distinguished from one another. 
(i) and (ii) may occur in the same preparation. The difference between (ii) and (iii) 
may become one only of degree, and between (iii) and (iv) only one of regularity. 
(b) Molecular weight determination 
The use of X-ray measurements to determine chemical molecular weights follows 
from the relation between the crystal density and the volume and mass of the crystal 
unit cell: 
nM
UP V'
where p is the density, V the volume of the unit cell, n the number of molecules in the 
unit, and M, the mass of the individual molecule, is equal to the chemical molecular 
weight multiplied by the mass of an atom of hydrogen. The routine measurement of 
the molecular weight depends therefore on the precision with which the quantities 
p, V and n can be determined. Of these n must be an integer and is fixed by the 
arrangement of the molecules in the unit cell. Where the order of magnitude of the 
required molecular weight is known, n can easily be assigned by an approximate 
calculation. The exact numerical accuracy of the measurement depends therefore on 
the determination of p and V. 
By the employment of precision X-ray goniometers it is now possible to measure 
lattice constants with an accuracy of a few parts in 100,000, and these determine the 
cell volumes. The limiting factor in the accuracy of the molecular weight measurement 
is therefore probably the density, though Hendricks (1933) has shown that with careful 
choice of crystals and the use of a laboratory centrifuge to follow their flotation in 
suitable solutions, it is possible to measure crystal densities with a probable error of 
not more than 0-0001. No measurements in the sterol series have yet been made to 
this degree of precision, though it is probable that such measurements would be valuable 
in the case of, for example, calciferol, where the number of hydrogen atoms has been 
in doubt. For the first order examination of the sterols, as of most organic compounds, 
it has been considered sufficient to use methods that will determine the number of 
carbon atoms in the molecule, and for this purpose an accuracy of + 1-5 %0 is adequate. 
The standard laboratory X-ray goniometers have therefore been used, and for the 
density determination the flotation method under centrifugal force, preferably with 
a dust of small crystals (Bernal and Crowfoot 1934a). The solution generally employed 
has been sodium chloride in water with a drop or two of sodium taurocholeate solution 
to assist the wetting of the crystals. Occasionally zinc sulphate solution was used 
instead. The measurements on a number of different sterols are recorded in table 6. 
In the study of a series of compounds it is evidently unnecessary to measure exactly 
the molecular weight of every compound. One set of precision measurements on a 
suitable compound should suffice to define the series. The choice of such a compound 
depends first on its occurrence in good crystals and secondly, if an absolute determina-

tion is desired, on the actual crystal structure adopted. In the sterol series, particularly 
among hydroxy compounds, the asymmetric unit of the crystal structure is frequently 
composed of two or more molecules, and the crystallographic maximum molecular 
weight is this multiple of the chemical minimum value. For an unambiguous measure- 
ment it is generally possible to find some member of the series in which the space 
group alone determines n, the number of molecules in the unit cell. This is the case 
with cholestenone, ergotetraene and y-spinasterol acetate recorded below and with 
calciferol-pyrocalciferol measured by Bernal (1932), and the measurements on these 
compounds may be considered to define the cholesterol, ergosterol, spinasterol and 
calciferol series. Cholestenone in particular forms very good crystals of which morpho- 
logical measurements were made by Jaeger in 1908. The X-ray results given in table 6 
are recorded using the axes chosen by Jaeger, though these have been changed in 
tables 1-5 for the sake of the general classification. The density now measured is 
slightly but not significantly higher than that found by Jaeger (1 -071). The crystals 
of ergotetraene used were much less good and had a fibrous appearance. Though 
fragile, they show no cleavage. The results on y-spinasterol acetate are of particular 
interest, since they show that the spinasterols, like sitosterol and stigmasterol (below), 
belong to the C 29 group of plant sterols and not to the C 28, ergosterol, group as 
previously accepted on chemical grounds (Heyl and Larsen 1934). 
For most of the measurements of molecular weight in the higher plant sterol series 
only hydroxy compounds were available. The crystals of these suffer not only from the 
formal disadvantage that the asymmetric unit contains two or four chemical molecules 
but also that there is present water of crystallization, the proportion of which should 
be determined by separate chemical analysis. But the crystal structures of these 
compounds are extremely similar to that of hydrated ergosterol and it seems con- 
sequently reliable to place the same interpretation upon them all. The weight of 
ergosterol itself is crystallographically defined by that of ergotetraene, and there is the 
further evidence of Tanret's analyses of the water content of ergosterol hydrate crystals 
(Tanret i889, I908) to demonstrate that the ergosterol molecule has a weight of 
C28H440, and that two are present each associated with a molecule of water in the 
crystal asymmetric unit. The crystallographic data on stigmasterol, /B- and y-sitosterol 
may be interpreted by comparison with this conclusion. The value so deduced for 
stigmasterol agrees with that found by chemical methods (Sandqvist and Gorton 1930; 
Windaus, v. Werder and Gschaider I932), though it is a little low, probably owing to 
the cracked nature of the crystals used. The weight found for y-sitosterol agrees very 
exactly with that suggested by earlier data on mixed sitosterol preparations, and 
although it is unlikely that the sample used now is quite pure, it may be taken as 
evidence of the C 29 formula for this sterol. The value for fl-sitosterol from rubber is 
supported by the X-ray measurements on the acetate and has been chemically 
confirmed.*

Where the weight of the sterol molecule present is known the X-ray measurement 
may be applied rather differently, to the exact determination on a small quantity of 
material of the proportion of solvent of crystallization present. This application is 
illustrated by the measurements recorded on zI-4-cholestene-7-ol (#-cholesterol), chole- 
stanol and /I-ergostadienetriol (leaflet form). The X-ray photographs of cholestanol 
invariably show in addition traces of lines corresponding to a smaller unit cell with 
a c spacing 34-2 A, probably due to the formation of a lower hydrate.

(c) The stereochemistry of the carbon skeleton of the sterols 
If the carbon skeleton written above (II) is accepted as in outline a correct 
representation of sterol structure, there are still a number of stereochemical alternatives 
among which the exact arrangement of the atoms in the individual molecules must 
be sought. A large proportion of these can be excluded by the crystallographic evidence, 
particularly on cholesteryl chloride and bromide, which requires the presence in these 
derivatives of a reasonably flat molecule. And bearing this in mind it is a simplification 
to consider separately the nature of the junctions between rings A and B, B and C, 
and C and D and where these differ in the different sterols studied, their relation, if 
any, to the crystallographic data. The descriptions cis and trans may be applied here 
as in the cis and trans decalins. 
There is as yet no X-ray evidence on the nature of the junction between rings C 
and D, which is usually, on evidence supplied by Wieland and Dane (I933), considered 
to be trans. The configuration here is almost certainly the same in all the compounds 
so far examined. But a certain modification in the relative positions of the atoms 
surrounding this junction is to be expected in compounds having double bonds 
impinging on it as in the structures proposed for x- and /I-ergostenol III, IV (Achter- 
mann I934; F. Laucht, I935). These two compounds differ markedly from one another, 
c-ergostenol crystallizing in the ab (21) group, /I-ergostenol in the normal a 212 group, 
but it is not possible from the data so far collected to associate their differences with 
their molecular configuration. The same may be said of /-dihydrofucosterol for which 
a structure with a double bond in ring D has been suggested (V) (Heilbron et al. 1936), 
and which crystallizes in a complex variant of the a type structure, so far peculiar to itself. 
The junction between rings B and C is generally considered to be trans to fit the

general requirements of the X-ray measurements (cf. Ruzicka and Thomann I933). 
It should be stated that in the sterols themselves this determination has not anything 
like the certainty of that of the parallel decision in the case of the cis and trans hexa- 
hydrochrysenes (Bernal I933). In the completely reduced ring system there is much 
greater freedom of movement and models can be constructed with a cis central junction 
nearly as flat as those where the junction is trans. But where one ring is aromatic as 
in oestrone, the more rigid conditions hold, and here it is certain that the central 
junction must be trans. The relations between the sterol and sex-hormone group justify 
one in extending this condition to all normal members of the series, especially when it 
is realized that any change of the configuration of the central junction made without 
corresponding changes at the junction C to D completely alters the shape of the 
molecule. The X-ray evidence also applies a restriction on the possibilities of isomerism 
at C 10, since to keep the molecule flat the substituent hydrogen or methyl at C 10 
must in the general case be trans to that at C 9.

These considerations are particularly relevant to the question of the structures of 
lumisterol and of pyrocalciferol. Chemical evidence leads to the conclusion that the 
molecule of lumisterol differs from that of ergosterol only in the stereochemistry of the 
ring system at C 10 (VI), while in pyrocalciferol the arrangement of the atoms at 
C 9 is also affected (VII) (Windaus and Dimroth I937; Heilbron, Kennedy, Spring 
and Swain I938). Both these changes produce considerable alteration in the molecular 
shape, and it seems significant therefore that neither of these two compounds is 
crystallographically of a simple type. Lumisterol and its derivatives, the hexahydro- 
lumisterol acetates, show a marked approximation to pseudo-hexagonal symmetry, 
and while the simplest interpretation of the structure following from the optics leads 
to the deduction of relatively flat molecules, it is possible to see in their greatly 
sloped arrangement an adjustment to some change in molecular configuration. Pyro- 
calciferol shows certain relations crystallographically to lumisterol. The asymmetric 
unit is doubled, but there is no apparent double layer formation, and this makes it 
impossible at this stage to draw further conclusions from the X-ray data on the 
molecular shape. 
In the junction between rings A and B the arrangement may be either cis or trans, 
and the chemical evidence shows it to be trans in the cholestane allo-cholanic acid

series, passing to cis in the coprostane-cholanic acid series. Compounds of both groups 
have been examined crystallographically, but the differences between them do not at 
this stage appear to be diagnostic. It is perhaps interesting, however, that coprostene 
(VIII) and coprostane (IX) are crystallographically closely related-a fact which 
may have some stereochemical significance. Cholestene (X) and cholestane (XI), on 
the other hand, both crystallize in rather irregular structures.

One of the sharpest distinctions in the geometrical classification of sterol crystal

been already suggested (p. 156) that the difference between the two is generally due 
to association between terminal hydroxyl groups, which in the double-layer structures 
causes doubling of the crystal asymmetric unit in the direction of the molecular length.

Such behaviour is well known among the fatty acids and long-chain alcohols, and its 
occurrence in the sterol series receives additional support from the direct relation of 
the characteristic sterol double-layer crystal structures to the crystal structure of 
dicholesteryl ether. This compound crystallizes in the space group A 2, and the unit 
cell which contains four chemical molecules shows very much the same dimensions 
as those of ostreasterol and actiniasterol for which the space group is also A 2, but the 
asymmetric unit double the chemical molecule: cf.

Ostreasterol 1010 7.65 78-6 1170 8 
Actiniasterol 10412 7.58 82.0 121? 8 
In dicholesteryl ether the doubling of the molecular length is produced by the chemical 
elimination of water between the hydroxyl groups, and these must evidently be 
terminally placed in the sterol skeleton to produce the effects observed- the crystal 
structure of this compound might indeed be quoted as the best single piece of evidence 
from the crystallographic side for the terminal position of the hydroxyl group of 
cholesterol. Actually the removal of one hydroxyl group in its formation probably 
forces the two component cholesterol chains of the ether to lie at a certain angle to 
one another which may account for some of the deviations of its crystal structure from 
the strictly normal double-layer types. But the general relation between the doubling 
of the molecule in dicholesteryl ether and the formation of many of the sterol double- 
layer structures is plain. And since it was the consideration of these that was first 
employed to demonstrate from the crystallographic side that the hydroxyl group of 
ergosterol and cholesterol was terminally placed at position C 3, it is worth considering 
how far the formation of a crystal double layer among sterols is absolutely specific for 
the presence of a terminal hydroxyl group. 
In the general classification (table 5) the single-layer structure types are a 111, 
a 211, a 411, b 211, b 221, ab (21)1, ab (22)1 and c 221, to which must be added 
certain groups in which no association is possible between equivalent atoms, a 112; 
a 212, C2, A2, P212121; ab (21)2, A2; and c 112. All the rest can be classified as 
double-layer types, and it is very significant that out of the forty-eight compounds in 
the table belonging to this class thirty-three are known to have a hydroxyl group at 
the same position as cholesterol, C 3. In the case of seven others, actiniasterol, brassica- 
sterol, the spinasterols, and the cerevisterols, the position of the hydroxyl group has 
not yet been chemically proved but is almost certainly again C 3. The remaining eight 
are intrusions into the group whose nature requires more careful consideration. They

tion to orthorhombic symmetry, and even the preliminary examination might suggest 
that the doubling of the asymmetric unit is here rather different from that produced 
by association of hydroxyl groups and due to some more purely geometrical aspect of 
molecule packing. The same may be said of the remaining exceptions, but it is plain 
that it would be practically impossible to distinguish at least between the other 
acetates and normal double-layer structures on the data so far collected. The remaining 
two compounds, cholestane-4-ol and 6-ol, raise still further problems. The examination 
of cholestane-4-ol has not yet been taken as far as space group determination, but it is 
certain that the structure type is not exactly that shown by any of the derivatives 
examined with the hydroxyl group at C 3. This seems very reasonable. The hydroxyl 
group is in a nearly terminal position, and a double layer would be expected, as 
observed, rather different in character from the normal variety. Cholestane-6-ol EtOH 
is, on the other hand, exceedingly similar morphologically to cholesterol H20. It is, 
in fact, the only derivative in the table that might on cursory inspection be mistaken 
for cholesterol H20. The crystal structure in both cases is of an irregular and com- 
plicated variety from which it is impossible to expect to draw exact conclusions at this 
stage. And while a very natural deduction from the direct comparison of the two 
structures would certainly be that in both the hydroxyl group is at C 3, one fact, the 
further doubling of the c dimension in cholesterol H20 compared with cholestane-6-ol, 
is against it. In any case there is evidently a relation of an intimate geometrical 
character between cholestane-6-ol and cholesterol H20. 
In the formation of double-layer structures the terminal hydroxyl groups may either 
interact directly with one another or through water molecules. Examples of both 
varieties of interaction are well known already in the crystal structures of oxalic acid 
and oxalic acid dihydrate (Hendricks 1935; Robertson 1936). Among the sterols the 
first process seems frequently attended by some difficulty, witness the extremely com- 
plicated structures of anhydrous cholesterol and ergosterol and the great readiness 
with which crystals, particularly of the latter and many closely related sterols, take 
up water or alcohol of crystallization. The crystal structures belonging to the simplest 
type, the normal a 212 structures (figure 6), probably nearly all contain such water, 
and it seems likely from the structure of cholesterol MeOH that methyl alcohol can 
play a similar part to water in joining hydroxyl groups. The case of ethyl alcohol, 
however, is more doubtful. That this is associated with the sterol hydroxyl group in 
crystallization is demonstrated by the exceedingly close relation between i-cholesterol 
ethyl ether and i-cholesterol EtOH, which show not only approximate identity of unit- 
cell dimensions but also of X-ray intensities. Both structures are essentially single-layer 
structures, and it might be argued that here ethyl alcohol of crystallization has closed 
the hydroxyl bond chain and so prevented further interaction, a type of behaviour 
that would be relevant also to the problem of the cholestane-6-ol structure. 
The single-layer class is characteristically the structure type of hydrocarbons, 
halogen derivatives, ethers, esters and ketones, in none of which are there specific

chemical groups likely to cause association between molecules. But the intrusions of 
hydroxyl compounds into this division are both common and varied. In table 5 the 
list includes androsterone, ca- and /-ergostadienetriol, trans-A -5-6-cholestene-3-4-diol, 
pyrocalciferol, oestrone-1 and androstane-3-(/)-ol-17-one, all of which from chemical 
evidence have at least one hydroxyl group at C 3, and two compounds in 
which the hydroxyl group is known to be differently placed, z-4-cholestene-7-ol 
(#-cholesterol) and cholestane-5-ol-3-6-dione together with i-cholesterol EtOH, in 
which there is still some doubt about the exact position of the hydroxyl group. In all 
of these it seems probable that hydroxyl or hydrogen bond formation does occur, 
though this does not lead to the appearance of a double layer. The classical example 
is provided by oestrone (figure 5) in which hydrogen bonds can be formed between 
the terminal hydroxyl and keto groups of neighbouring molecules, and this interaction 
takes the place of double-layer formation. The process is better illustrated by the 
crystal structures of androsterone and the isomeric hydroxyketone from cholesterol 
where the molecule is itself the asymmetric unit rather than by oestrone and oestriol 
where for other reasons the asymmetric unit is doubled. Among the polyhydroxy 
compounds, c'- and /?-ergostadienetriol, and trans-Z1-5-6-cholestene-3-4-diol interaction 
is possible either (or both) between hydroxyl groups within a single molecule or between 
non-equivalent hydroxyl groups in neighbouring molecules. In cholestane-3-6-dione- 
5-ol, a hydrogen bond may be formed between the hydroxyl group and a neighbouring 
keto group within one molecule. And it is likely that the double layer of cis-Z-5-6- 
cholestene-3-4-diol is not quite of the normal type suggested superficially by its 
classification, but that here again the hydroxyl bonds, though leading to double-layer 
formation, are between non-equivalent groups on the two molecules concerned. The 
remaining two compounds, pyrocalciferol and D-4-cholestene-7-ol, are in a slightly 
different category, since the essential association may in these cases be between 
equivalent groups though no double layer is shown. Pyrocalciferol provides the most 
awkward exception so far encountered-the only compound for which there is chemical 
evidence that the hydroxyl group is at C 3 and in which there is only the one hydroxyl 
group and yet no double layer has been formed. The asymmetric unit is actually 
doubled in another direction, so that it is possible for association between the hydroxyl 
groups to have occurred in some other way, but the crystal structure certainly calls 
for further investigation. In D-4-cholestene-7-ol, on the other hand, the crystal structure 
shows precisely the behaviour that might be expected from a compound having a 
single hydroxyl group remote from any terminal position. The crystals contain water 
of crystallization presumably associated with the hydroxyl groups, and this may even 
be employed to link them together if the molecules are so arranged in the unit cell 
that the hydroxyl groups are brought not far from 3 05 A away from one another, the 
closest approach which is crystallographically permissible (figure 4). 
Taking altogether the evidence now collected on sterol crystal structures, it is clear 
that this adds considerable weight to the correlation of the double-layer structures

CRYSTALLOGRAPHY AND THE CHEMISTRY OF STEROIDS 169 
with the presence of terminal hydroxyl groups. But since on the one side there are 
compounds which show a crystallographic double layer though they contain no 
terminal hydroxyl group, and on the other, at least one compound, pyrocalciferol, 
which, although chemical evidence indicates the presence of a terminal hydroxyl 
group, shows no double layer, it is clear that some caution must be exercised in applying 
this criterion to place hydroxyl groups on the sterol skeleton. Where there is very great 
similarity between the crystal structures of the compounds under investigation and 
a sterol structure of known type it seems safe to apply the argument rigidly. The 
crystal structures, both in cell dimensions and character of the X-ray intensities, of 
brassicasterol and the cerevisterols are so like those of ergosterol, ostreasterol and 
actiniasterol that it is impossible to doubt that the hydroxyl group is in all cases in the 
same position. But it is much more difficult to place crystallographically the hydroxyl 
group of i-cholesterol. The chemical evidence on this compound has been somewhat 
conflicting, but the work of Wallis, Fernholz and Gephart (I937) and Heilbron, 
Hodges and Spring (1938) strongly favours the formula below (XII) with the hydroxyl 
group at C 6 and not C 3 as first proposed: 
OH
XII
Crystallographically Miss Bell finds that the acetate, ethyl ether and i-cholesterol 
EtOH are all very much alike. The only cholesterol derivative, so far examined, which 
they at all closely resemble is, as table 5 shows, dibromocholesteryl chloride in which 
there are substituents both at C 3, and at C 5 and C 6. This crystal structure is one in 
which the molecules have an imbricated arrangement which renders it particularly 
difficult to place the substituent groups from the preliminary examination. It is also 
impossible to place the methoxy group of i-cholesterol methyl ether from the data at 
present collected, owing again to the unspecific character of the structure type, a 211, 
in which it crystallizes. From the table it appears as closely related to oxycholestenone 
dibromide and dichlorcholestane, which probably have substituents at C 5 or C 6, as 
it is to cholesterol methyl ether with the substituent at C 3. But the crystal structure 
of this methyl ether is sufficiently simple to hope that it may be submitted to an exact 
analysis, the solution of which would be the more interesting in view of the somewhat 
paradoxical relations which exist chemically between the i-cholesterol compounds, 
cholesterol and cholestane 6-ol on the one hand and crystallographically, as mentioned 
above, between cholesterol and cholestane 6-ol.

(ii) The stereochemistry of the hydroxyl group at position 3. 
A priori one might imagine that the crystal structure would be one of the physical 
properties of a compound most sensitive to a stereochemical change such as that of 
the hydroxyl group of the sterols between the epi and normal series. Models show 
that with a trans configuration of the ring system between C 5 and C 10, in one isomer 
which, following Ruzicka, Furter and Goldberg (1938), we may call cis, the hydroxyl 
group should project vertically from the ring system, in the other, trans, it should lie 
almost in the plane of the ring system (figure 7). We might expect that cis isomers 
would show rather different crystal structures from trans, or at least a definite 
shortening of the molecular length. 
"trans', cis" 
FIGURE 7. The stereochemistry of the sterol hydroxyl group at C 3. 
As far as the present examination goes there does not appear to be any definite 
change in crystal structure which one can associate with the change from cis to trans. 
An examination of molecular lengths of twelve compounds all of which crystallize in 
the normal type of structure and have only a terminal hydroxyl group does, how- 
ever, show a certain separation into two groups, the first having apparent lengths 
37-39 A, the second 34-35 A. (For this comparison the lengths are calculated from 
the slope of y to the c plane in the crystals.) 
Cholestanol 2H20 39-5 Epicholestanol 34.5 
Ergosterol H20 39.4 Lumisterol 34.4 
y-Sitosterol H20 39-6 Calciferol-pyrocalciferol 34.9 
y-Sitostanol 37.8 Calciferol 34.8 
/3-Ergostenol 38-0 Suprasterol I 34.8 
Stigmasterol H20 37.5 Dihydrocalciferol 36 1-37.6 
Further, this separation does correspond in scope to the chemical distinction between 
the normal and epi series and is paralleled among the sex hormones by the relation 
between androsterone and the hydroxy ketone from cholestanol. But the reliability 
of the natural deduction that therefore the normal cholesterol-ergosterol series have 
the trans and the epi series the cis configuration is much open to question. The normal 
series nearly all crystallize with water of crystallization which might independently 
cause an increase in length (it also might even be argued to be due to this being a more 
difficultly crystallizable cis form). And with- the exception of epi-cholestanol itself the 
entire 'short length' division consists of the photoderivatives of ergosterol about 
whose structures there is, to say the least, considerable doubt. 
Another approach to the problem can be made through a more detailed examination 
of the halogen derivatives of cholesterol. Calculations on the intensities of X-ray

CRYSTALLOGRAPHY AND THE CHEMISTRY OF STEROIDS 171 
reflexions from cholesteryl chloride and bromide show quite clearly that in these 
compounds the halogen atoms are not far from the plane of the ring system and so 
directed as to increase the molecular length. The most natural interpretation is that 
they have the trans configuration. But here the double bond at C 5: 6 may very easily 
affect the actual position in space adopted by a group at C 3, and it is stereochemically 
possible for atoms attached both at the cis and trans positions to lie fairly closely in the 
plane of the ring system. A better test is the study of the reduced derivatives, a- and 
6-chlorcholestanes, derived by the action of phosphorus pentachloride on epi- 
cholestanol and cholestanol respectively. The X-ray analysis has here not been carried 
so far, but the general crystallography and in particular the intensities of the c plane 
reflexions leave no doubt that it is the a compound that has the same configuration 
as cholesteryl chloride. This x compound can also be prepared by the direct reduction 
of cholesteryl chloride while reduction of cholesterol followed by the action of phos- 
phorus pentachloride gives cholestanol first and then /J-chlorcholestane. Further 
correlation of the configuration of cholesteryl chloride and ac-chlorcholestane with 
epi-cholestanol cannot therefore be carried through at this stage, since Walden 
inversion must have occurred at least once, if not several times, in the chemical reactions 
involved. But- the X-ray evidence does show that no such inversion occurs during the 
hydrogenation of cholesteryl chloride. It would probably be most useful to examine 
in more detail the crystallographically very similar cholesteryl methyl ether. 
It is interesting that the general similarity between the epi and normal cholesterol 
series in relation to the packing together of the molecules in the crystals is paralleled 
by their behaviour in surface films (Adam, Askew and Danielli 1935). The limiting 
surface pressure areas show no significant differences between the two series though 
there does appear to be a change in surface potential. And while this should be 
valuable to assist in distinguishing an epi from a normal compound it does not provide 
a clue as to which has which configuration. 
(iii) The positions qf the double bonds. 
The two most important types of reaction by which the double bond in cholesterol 
is characterized are perhaps its behaviour on oxidation and towards halogens. Products 
of both courses of treatment are recorded in table 5. 
As the general review of these crystal structures has shown, the introduction of 
hydroxyl groups has a very marked influence on the kind of molecular arrangement 
adopted. The five polyhydroxy sterols described, ox-cholestanetriol, x- and fl-ergo- 
stadienetriol, cis and trans J-5-6-cholestene-3-4-diols show crystal structures classified 
in seven different divisions of the table-five different space groups including poly- 
morphic forms. A direct comparison of these structures, either among themselves or 
with others, from the point of view of establishing intensity relations is therefore rather 
difficult. But in all there are signs that the structure adopted is largely determined by 
the tendency to form hydroxyl bonds between the hydroxyl groups and, if this is

accepted, it is possible to put forward plausible suggestions as to their whereabouts. 
As far as it goes the crystallographic evidence is fairly well in agreement with the 
chemical as to the position of the hydroxyl groups in these compounds. In the case 
of oc-ergostadienetriol and ergosterol peroxide it is inclined to favour a C5-6 con- 
figuration of the oxygen atoms. But the crystal structures of these two compounds are 
of fairly simple types and might be worth more exact study. 
The halogen derivatives examined are most promising crystallographically though 
still inclined to appear a very miscellaneous collection. Eight of them crystallize in 
the a 211 group and are nearly isomorphous. A direct comparison between two of 
these, cholesteryl chloride and cholesteryl chloride hydrochloride, has therefore been 
possible. Chemically cholesteryl chloride hydrochloride differs from cholesteryl 
chloride by the addition of hydrogen chloride at the double bond. Crystallographically 
this alteration affects mainly the intensities of the X-ray reflexions, and the change 
can be followed by forming the Patterson projection, Pxz, from the intensities of the 
hol planes. Compared with the corresponding projection of cholesteryl chloride 
(figure 1 C) the resulting diagram (figure 8 A) shows a new series of peaks due both 
to new chlorine-chlorine interatomic distances and to distances between the additional 
chlorine atom and the carbon skeleton. Figure 8 B shows a probable arrangement of 
the molecules which correlates the observed effects. From the chemical point of view 
the most significant feature of the pattern is the fact that the new peaks lie between 
the old lines, showing that the additional chlorine atom projects from the main line 
of the carbon skeleton, and the peak A in particular from its strength can be identified 
as due to the chlorine-chlorine distance within the molecule. This chlorine-chlorine 
distance, 4-2 A, accurately fixes the additional chlorine atom of cholesteryl chloride 
hydrochloride-and therefore one end of the cholesterol double-bond system in the 
neighbourhood of C 5, which is in agreement with present chemical theory. 
Unfortunately all the compounds so far examined in which two halogen atoms have 
been added to the double bond show different types of structure from one another. 
The orthorhombic forms in which imbrication occurs such as dibromocholesteryl 
chloride and bromide are most difficult to solve, but coprostene dibromide and dibromo- 
cholesterol should prove possible. Work has been started on a survey of the intensities 
of these compounds by G. Knott. 
One of the most characteristic reactions of the double-bond system of ergosterol is 
that with maleic anhydride. The two ergosterol acetate maleic anhydride adducts 
that can be obtained have both been examined by G. E. R. Schulze (1935), and a 
further study of that melting at 216? (I) has been made by us. This shows, in its crystal 
structure, some deviations from the normal type, while the second adduct appears, 
like the dibromide, to show more usual cell dimensions. Schulze gives for II: 
c-25-3, b 7-91, a= 32-2A, 8-92-10, 
(our a) (our c)

while for the adduct I the measurements are 
a = 105, b = 9 5, c= 33.2, A= 111? (table 2). 
Accepting the chemical interpretation of adduct formation as likely to occur normal 
to the ring system and hence produce an increase in the thickness of the molecule 
and seeing that it is b that has increased in size in the adduct I compared with the 
normal structure, Schulze draws the conclusion that b in the normal type sterol

structures represents molecular thickness and a the width. This is a conclusion that 
cannot be accepted for sterol crystals in general. It is contrary to the evidence of both 
the optics and the X-ray intensities, both in this compound and in the normal 
structures. And since Schulze's paper was written the calculations on cholesteryl 
bromide show that only an orientation with the thickness mainly in (100) can give 
the experimentally observed effects.

An alternative explanation might therefore be given that the maleic anhydride 
adds on to the molecule at the side of the ring system, so that, as observed, the dimension 
corresponding to the width is increased in the adduct. A possible formulae satisfying 
this requirement is XIII 
AcO-

While this is a crystallographically plausible explanation there is another which seems 
more probable. As discussed above, direct deductions of molecular dimensions from 
lattice dimensions must not be interpreted too rigidly. In the first place it is probable 
that the plane of the ring system, if 'mainly' in the a plane, is still at a considerable 
angle, as much as 300, to it. And further, in the adduct the space group, and con- 
sequently the relative arrangement of the molecules, has changed compared with the 
strictly normal type. Since the molecule is here the asymmetric unit, the crystal 
structure can be fixed with a relative degree of certainty. The orientation with the 
length of the molecule along c, thickness roughly in the a plane and width in b, is 
supported both by the optics and by the appearance of 'smear' lines along the layer 
lines on photographs taken about [001] (figure 9). This arrangement shows that the 
molecules following each other along the c axis are separated by a distance lb compared 
with those in, for example, cholesteryl bromide. In such a structure it is possible to 
insert the extra atoms of the maleic anhydride with adduct formation (as suggested 
by chemical investigation) at C 5-8 provided that the adduct is given the stereo- 
chemical form which brings the atoms nearest to the plane of the sterol ring system. 
These widely varying interpretations that have been put on the crystallographic 
measurements on ergosterol maleic anhydride adduct acetate are evidence of a weak- 
ness in the X-ray method of attacking this particular problem by preliminary measure- 
ment alone. The adducts do, however, appear much more promising subjects for further 
investigation than might have been expected on general considerations. 
(e) A comparison of the crystallography of different sterols (monohydroxy compounds) 
The changes in the structure of the carbon skeleton of the sterols with which we 
have to deal are chemically of four main types: (1) stereochemical only, e.g. in the 
disposition of carbon atoms around the ring junctions; (2) alterations in the number 
or distribution of double bonds; (3) introduction or removal of carbon atoms, e.g. as 
methyl groups; (4) actual breakdown of the sterol ring system as in the proposed

structure for calciferol. Of these types of change we have 
already to a certain extent considered (1) in relation to 
problems of sterol stereochemistry as a whole and (2) in 
relation to the identification of double bonds through 
chemical modification. (3) might be treated as an addi- 
tional case of the effect of substituent groups on sterol 
crystallography. But actually, in studying new sterol 
derivatives, we must expect to find modifications of all 
these kinds occurring at once. It seems useful therefore 
to review the experimental data from a somewhat different 
angle in order to discover how far the observed crystallo- 
graphic character can be associated with the sterol skeleton 
as such, and from this how far it may be sensitive to 
changes of each of the above types in turn and particu- 
larly to those of type (4). The actual similarities and 
differences that do exist among as wide as possible a 
group of sterol derivatives must evidently be considered, 
and for this purpose only compounds with a single 
hydroxyl group at C 3 have been selected in order to 
limit as far as possible the deviations in crystallography 
to those due to changes in the sterol skeleton itself. 
There are in table 5 twenty-seven sterol derivatives 
which have according to the available evidence a single 
hydroxyl group at position 3 and differ from one another 
either stereochemically or in the structure of the sterol 
skeleton. Of these it is noticeable that the four completely 
reduced compounds examined, y-sitostanol, spinastanol, 
cholestanol, epicholestanol and perhydro epidihydro pyro- 
calciferol, together with x-spinastenol, all occur in one 
group with the space grqup P1, class a 212. These crystal 
structures are, however, not so closely alike among them- 
selves as are those of a second group which includes all 
the higher plant and animal sterols examined and which 
may be referred to as the ergosterol H20 group after the 
type structure, ergosterol H20. These ten compounds, 
ergosterol, stigmasterol, fi- and y-sitosterol, brassicasterol, 
ostreasterol, actiniasterol, fl-dihydrofucosterol, fl-ergo- 
stenol and also dehydroergosterol, although they fall into 
a number of different classification groups in table 5, all 
have crystal structures based on the fundamental a 212 
type and show similarities in spacings and the general

CRYSTALLOGRAPHY AND THE CHEMISTRY OF STEROIDS 177 
run of the intensities of reflexions which are of a different order of magnitude from 
any other likenesses observed. 
The remaining eleven structures are very miscellaneous both chemically anc 
crystallographically. While they do include a number in which the sterol skeleton 
may have radically altered, such as neoergosterol and all the photoderivatives of 
ergosterol, they also include the crystal structures of cholesterol, anhydrous and 
hydrated, and that of anhydrous ergosterol which prevents the main distinction from 
having much significance. Neoergosterol may be mentioned as crystallographically 
of particular interest. The crystal structure is of a curious and complicated kind, unlike 
any other, and the X-ray photographs taken about the b axis show marked layer line 
'smearing', indicating some degree of irregularity in the arrangement of the mole- 
cules. Some of the other crystal structures are of the same structure type as the 
ergosterol H20 group, e.g. dihydrocalciferol, others are much more complicated. 
It is possible, however, to attempt a further comparison of these structures with those 
of the characteristically normal group by a consideration of the intensities of the 
X-ray reflections from the c plane. 
Variations in the intensities of the X-ray reflexions from one crystal structure to 
another can be analysed as depending on two factors, the variation in the molecular 
arrangement and in the molecular structure. By considering the c plane intensities 
only of structures, all of which are of a double-layer type, it may be hoped to exclude, 
as far as possible in a preliminary survey, variations of the first kind and to obtain 
records which will be sensitive mainly to differences in molecular structure. Figure 10 
provides a list of the c plane intensities of all the sterol derivatives of the type now 
considered which show double-layer structures and for which sufficient data were 
obtained. The records are arranged to correspond roughly in spacing, i.e. the fourth 
order in the cholesterol H20 and ostreasterol structures corresponds to the second in 
ergosterol H20 and is therefore written in column 2. The only compounds which are 
excluded from the list as not possessing comparable double-layer structures are 
lumisterol and pyrocalciferol, for both of which there is chemical evidence that stereo- 
chemical changes of type (1) have occurred (cf. p. 164). 
The comparison of the c plane intensities illustrates again the very close relation 
between all the members of the ergosterol H20 group. Through the individual varia- 
tions the same general curve can be traced and the form of this is illustrated in a rather 
interesting way by the data on /I-dihydrofucosterol and dehydroergosterol. Both, 
crystals were very poor and certainly impure, and the result on the X-ray intensities 
appears as a blurring of individual differences while the general ' sterol' form remains. 
After these very close similarities other resemblances can be traced, particularly 
between anhydrous ergosterol and cholesterol and again, with a possibly characteristic 
difference at the seventh order, between these and the normal hydrated structures. 
Epicholestanol, on the other hand, shows certain differences perhaps significant which 
are paralleled, though very approximately, by dihydrocalciferol. The member of the

group which deviates most is o-ergostenol, and the differences here are probably to be 
associated rather with change in molecular arrangement than directly with molecular 
structure. It is clear that differences are in general much less significant in comparisons 
of this kind than are similarities and it is consequently the more important that the 
calciferol group, particularly calciferol itself, and to a lesser degree the suprasterols, 
do all show a formal likeness in c plane intensities to the normal sterol group. At the 
same time their differences in structure type can all be paralleled among normal 
sterols. 
From the general grouping it is clear that the crystallographic character is much 
more sensitive to changes in the structure of the ring system than to changes in the 
side chain. All the compounds in which radical alteration of the ring system is 
suspected do belong, if in somewhat different degrees, to the deviating group. But 
beyond this it is difficult to make any generalization of diagnostic value. 
(f) The structure of calciferol 
The structure of calciferol must be closely related to the position of the double-bond 
system in ergosterol and as far as this goes the crystallographic evidence is not contrary 
to the chemical evidence. The structure of ,-ergostadienetriol is in good agreement 
with the presence of one double bond in ergosterol at C 5-6 and that of Z1-4-cholestene- 
7-ol (#-cholesterol) is some confirmation for a more distant situation of the second 
double bond. But calciferol itself, according to the chemical evidence accumulated in 
the last four years, is formed from ergosterol through lumisterol and tachysterol by 
the rupture of ring B at the tachysterol stage of the transformation (Lettre I934, 
Muller 1935; Windaus and Thiele 1935; Heilbron, Samant and Spring 1935). In the 
present accepted structure for calciferol, ring A is therefore joined by a short chain to 
rings C and D. While this formula is usually written in the configuration XIV, it would 
seem almost certain physically that such a molecule should assume configuration XV: 
CH,
HO~~~~~~~~~~~~H 
HO 1OH 
XIV XV 
Calciferol would in this case be expected to show marked differences in crystal 
structure from the normal sterol structures whereas actually on its preliminary examina-

tion it was its similarity that appeared most significant (cf. Bernal and Crowfoot 
'935).
It is possible now to carry the crystallographic comparison of calciferol and its 
derivatives with other sterols a stage further from the material discussed in the 
preceding section. This has made it clear that actually none of the calciferol group 
do belong to the most characteristically 'steroid' ergosterol H20 group, though 
amongst themselves they deviate from this in very different degrees. Dihydrocalciferol 
crystallizes in the normal a 212 structure type and its divergence from the ergosterol 
group is comparatively minor, a certain shortening of b and lengthening of a sin , 
which also occurs in calciferol-pyrocalciferol, pyrocalciferol and calciferol itself. 
Pyrocalciferol is perhaps the most radically different in crystal structure, and this 
compound is agreed on chemical grounds to have an abnormal sterol skeleton. 
Calciferol and pyrocalciferol-calciferol are, on the other hand, more closely related 
to the normal group; the relation of calciferol in particular is shown by the comparison 
of the c plane intensities with those of the ergosterol H20 group. They show very 
marked similarities suggesting the presence of closely similar atomic groupings. 
Further, the crystallographic interpretation of the data on the suprasterols, particularly 
suprasterol I, is definitely against the presence of a spiro ring system here (IIiller 
1935), though it cannot exclude other ring systems which would conform to lath shape 
in type (cf. Rosenheim and King 1935). 
It is, however, admittedly impossible to exclude the broken-ring formula for calciferol 
on the present crystallographic data without some information on the behaviour of 
compounds known to possess such structures. If it is actually possible for a molecular 
configuration approximating to XIV to be maintained in the crystal there is no reason 
to consider the crystallographic data conflicting with the chemical. So far the only 
compound examined crystallographically in which a ring-chain configuration at all 
comparable exists is cis azobenzene. And here the structure is definitely unstable and 
the planes of the benzene rings are disposed at a considerable angle to one another 
(Robertson 1939 b). It may, however, be argued that the aromatic system in cis 
azobenzene is not sufficiently close to that suggested for calciferol to make the com- 
parison of much value. But it should be possible to find other analogous compounds, 
perhaps in other series, to investigate. 
There is one rather interesting point in connexion with the vitamin-D problem that 
seems worth mentioning. Crystallographically fi- and y-sitosterols are very much more 
similar to ergosterol than is stigmasterol. The slope of the molecules to the c plane 
and the c plane intensities in the three compounds are practically identical. Chemically 
antirachitic products can be obtained by irradiation of both ergosterol and 7-dehydro- 
sitosterol, whereas that from stigmasterol is almost if not quite inactive. There seems to 
be a relation between the two sets of properties of the sitosterols and ergosterol for which 
the present chemical formulae, which make stigmasterol the most similar to ergosterol, 
provide no clue.

180 J. D. BERNAL, D. CROWFOOT AND I. FANKUCHEN ON X-RAY 
CONCLUSION 
The survey of sterol crystal structures which has been undertaken in this paper has 
illustrated very plainly the limitations of preliminary crystallographic investigation as 
a source of chemical information. Even in matters of straight identification there may 
be difficulties where impure preparations consisting largely of mixed crystals or where 
polymorphic modifications are concerned. Double-layer structures, though most 
frequently, are not quite exclusively associated with terminal hydroxyl groups, and 
deviations in crystal-structure type very often make it impossible to apply simple 
comparisons of X-ray intensities to fixing the positions of substituent groups. It is 
still desirable to extend the survey method to a number of problems which have been 
mentioned in the course of the discussion, for example, the behaviour of sterol mixtures, 
and also to cover more systematically different sterol types, to include, among others, 
epi-cholesterol and epi-coprostanol. But it is clear that the solutions of the most 
important problems of sterol structure must be sought from the crystallographic side 
by exact X-ray analysis and it is probably in this direction that the general survey 
should prove most useful. 
Where, as in the case of the sterols, the molecules, and therefore necessarily the 
crystal structures, have no centres of symmetry, it is essential to find comparatively 
simple crystal structures for intensive analysis. And at the same time it is desirable to 
choose those whose solution will answer the most outstanding questions of chemical 
structure. Of the structures listed in the tables the halogen and ether derivatives of 
cholesterol, and particularly ca- and fl-chlorcholestane should be useful both on account 
of simplicity of crystal structure and for their relation to the fundamental problem of 
the position and stereochemistry of the hydroxyl group of cholesterol. These have, 
however, one crystallographic disadvantage. The easiest approach to exact analysis in 
monoclinic crystals is through an analysis of the hol reflexions since an effective centre 
of symmetry appears for projections on the b plane at the position of the twofold axis. 
But for cx- and fl-chlorcholestane this projection should give the less instructive view 
of the sterol skeleton as a whole, roughly normal to the plane of the ring system. The 
alternative view over the extended ring system might be obtained from certain of the 
b or ab type structures. Of these J-4-cholestene-7-ol is probably the most hopeful and 
its relation to the preparation of 7-dehydrocholesterol and the antirachitic vitamin 
should make it chemically one of the most valuable. The direct analysis of calciferol 
itself is too difficult to attempt yet and it would possibly be useful in this connexion 
to extend the survey to the antirachitic products derived from cholesterol and sitosterol 
and their derivatives in the hopes of finding more suitable subjects. Of the calciferol 
derivatives already examined, dihydrocalciferol is the most promising, particularly 
if its analysis can be combined with that of ergosterol itself. Other compounds that 
may be mentioned here as both crystallographically and chemically eligible for further 
study are i-cholesterol mrethyl ether, cx- and /I-ergostadienetriol and ergosterol maleic 
anhydride adduct I.
