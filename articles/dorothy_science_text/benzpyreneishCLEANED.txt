The present work deals with the identification of 
the hydroxy and quinone derivatives of 3,4-benzpyrene, 
extracted from mouse and rat feces, as described in the 
preceding paper (I). In view of the labile nature of 
the hydroxy compound, BPX, and for other technical 
reasons, direct comparisons between these products and 
synthetic compounds were not actively pursued. In- 
stead, the products from the feces and some synthetic 
derivatives of benzpyrene were converted into methoxy 
and other derivatives, and comparisons were made of 
their crystallographic character and their fluorescence 
and absorption spectra. 
SYNTHETIC CONVERSION OF THE ISOLATED PRODUCTS 
INTO OTHER DERIVATIVES 
Hydroxy derivatives.--Attempts were made to con- 
vert the red quinone derivative isolated from the 
feces (I) into a hydroxy derivative, by reduction with 
Zn and H2SO4. A greenish yellow fluorescent product 
was obtained, which was strongly adsorbed on alumina. 
This could not be isolated, however, owing to its great 
instability in air, especially in the alkaline state, when 
it was almost instantaneously reconverted into the red 
compound. The same occurred on reduction of the 
mixture of synthetic 5,8- and 5,Io-quinones, prepared 
from benzpyrene by the method of Vollmann and 
his collaborators (6). Catalytic hydrogenation (with 
Adams' catalyst and H2 at atmospheric pressure) 
yielded similar unstable fluorescent products. 
These results were compatible with the view that, 
on reduction, both the red product from the feces 
and the synthetic quinones were converted into di- 
hydroxy derivatives of benzpyrene.

the more stable acetoxy compounds, but these also 
were not sufficiently stable to provide good yields of 
pure crystalline products with the small amounts of 
material available. Sufficient amounts of the crude 
products were obtained, however, for spectrographic 
analysis of their fluorescence. 
Methoxy derivatives.--The production of methoxy 
derivatives of benzpyrene by methylation of the meta- 
bolic hydroxy compound (BPX), and by reductive 
methylation of the red product from the feces and 
the synthetic quinones, proved to be the most satis- 
factory approach in the elucidation of the structures ~ 
of the substances concerned, the derivatives being 
fairly stable and yielding readily crystalline products. 
For the methylation of BPX, the crude fluorescent 
fraction from the feces, at the stage after evaporation 
in vacuo of the methanolic extract (i), was dissolved 
in excess of dimethyl sulfate, and heated with con- 
centrated aqueous NaOH for a short time; then it was 
well cooled and treated with methanol to facilitate 
the destruction of the excess of dimethyl sulfate by 
the alkali present. After further heating to complete 
the reaction, the mixture was diluted with water and 
the product transferred to benzene. The benzene ex- 
tract was washed repeatedly with water, dried with 
anhydrous Na.,SO~, and passed through a column of 
alumina. The methoxy compound passed through into 
the eluate, while unchanged BPX and other impuri- 
ties remained adsorbed. 
The benzene eluate exhibited an intense blue fluores- 
cence similar to that of BPX but, unlike the latter, 
the fluorescence remained unchanged on addition of 
alkali. 
The solution was evaporated to dryness and sub- 
limed in high vacuum. The main fraction distilled at 
about i io ~ C., and this was recrystallized from amyl 
acetate. A second fraction, coming over at about 
i5 o~ C., was present in too small an amount for 
crystallization. 
For reductive methylation of the red product from 
151

the feces, the substance was dissolved in dimethyl 
sulfate and boiled with concentrated aqueous NaOH 
and powdered zinc, until the mixture changed to 
a greenish yellow color, care being taken that sufficient 
NaOH was alway s present to maintain an alkaline 
reaction. The subsequent procedure was the same as 
in the case of the methylation of BPX, and on sub- 
limation in high vacuum the greater part came over 
at about i5 o~ C. (From subsequent comparisons it 
became clear that the second fraction of the methy- 
fated BPX, mentioned previously, was identical with 
the present product, its presence being due to a slow 
transformation of BPX into the quinone during the 
process of purification.) 
The mixture of 5,8- and 5,io-quinones, obtained 
synthetically by the oxidation of benzpyrene with 
chromic acid (6), was treated in the same way as 
the red product from the feces, and on sublimation 
in high vacuum of the resulting methoxy compounds, 
two fractions were obtained--one at about ioo ~ C. and 
the other at about i5 ~ C. Both were further purified 
by repeated crystallization. Subsequently small samples 
of the individual quinones (5,8- and 5,io- respectively) 
became available, 1 and these were separately converted 
into the corresponding methoxy compounds. By this 
means it became possible, to establish that the fraction 
of the mixture coming over at about I5 o~ C. was 
mainly the 5,8- derivative, and the one at about 1oo ~ C. 
the 5,Io- derivative. 
ANALYSTS 
Samples of the methoxy compounds derived from 
the methylation of BPX and reductive methylation of 
the mixture of synthetic quinones, were submitted for 
quantitative analysis in order to determine the num- 
ber of methoxy groups present.

search Institute of the Royal Cancer Hospital. They were pre- 
pared by oxidation of benzpyrene with chromic acid, and 
separated through their acetyl derivatives, according to the 
method of Vollmann and his collaborators (6). FLUORESCENCE SPECTRA 
The distinctive fluorescence spectra of benzpyrene 
and of many of its derivatives can be of considerable 
help in distinguishing the various compounds, even in 
the presence of many impurities. 
In the present work a semi-quantitative method of 
determining relative fluorescence intensity distribution 
in the wave length region 3,8oo-5,4oo A afforded a 
rapid and sensitive means of characterizing benzpyrene 
and its derivatives. A series of photographs of the 
fluorescence spectrum of the test substance in solution 
of graded concentration enabled curves of approximate 
intensity distribution to be drawn. The method pro- 
vides a much better representation than can be got 
from a single exposure. Examples of such curves are 
given in Fig. I. 
The results obtained from a study of the fluorescence 
spectra of the different products and derivatives in ben- 
zene may be summarized as follows: 
t. BPX (Fig. I, a) gave three major bands, the 
strongest being preceded by some fluorescence around 
4,i5o-4,25o A.. In addition, two bands of variable 
intensity were observed, one at about 3,9oo A and 
the other in the region of 5,4oo A. The former may 
possibly have been due to impurities; the latter (prob- 
ably extending further towards the long wave length 
when photographed on plates more sensitive to red) 
was weak when the BPX was dissolved in a neutral 
solvent (benzene) and very intense when in the 
presence of alkali (e.g. in benzene-methanol-ammonia 
mixture). This would account for the change in 
naked eye fluorescence from blue to green on addi- 
tion of alkali. 
2. The fluorescence bands of methylated BPX were 
practically identical with those of BPX itself in ben- 
zene, except that the band at the long wave length 
did not increase in intensity on addition of alkali. 
3- In the case of the dimethoxybenzpyrenes, obtained 
by reductive methylation of the synthetic quinones, 
the bands for the 5,8- were different from those of the 
5,io- (Fig. I, b and c), while those of the mixture 
appeared as a composite picture of the two (Fig. I, d). 
4. The bands of the methoxy compound obtained 
by reductive methylation of the red product from the 
feces (Fig. I, e) were indistinguishable from those of 
the synthetic 5,8- compound (Fig. I, b). 
5- The methoxy compound obtained by oxidizing 
BPX to the quinone followed by reductive methyla- 
tion, exhibited bands which were similar to (b) and 
(e) rather than to (d) of Fig. I. It is clear from 
this that the oxidation product was a single quinone 
(5,8-) and not a mixture.

ABSORPTION SPECTRA 
Preliminary investigations were made with the 
method previously described by one of the authors 
(5)- This method was found useful for rapidly com- 
paring absorption band systems of a crude mixture 
with those of purified reference substances. When 
purified products were ultimately obtained from the 
crude mixtures, final checking was made by compar- 
ing plots of absorption curves obtained with the benzpyrene (BPX) in both ethanol and hexane. In 
Fig. 2, the effect of methylation of the metabolic hy- 
droxybenzpyrene on the absorption spectrum is shown. 
From Figs. 2 and 3 it can be seen that definition of 
absorption band systems increases from the hydroxy 
in ethanol, to hydroxy in hexane, to methoxy in 
hexane. This is an added reason for using the methoxy 
derivative in hexane as a standard reference. The low 
solubility of these compounds in hexane has been given 
as a reason for not using this solvent (4)- If, however,

were 5 cm. long. 
Identity of absorption of the methoxy compound 
derived from the red product from the feces, with that 
of synthetic 5,8-methoxy-3,4-benzpyrene, is shown in 
Fig. 4. By contrast, the nonidentity with 5,io-di- 
methoxy-3,4-benzpyrene is shown in the same figure. 
In Fig. 3 is reproduced the curve of 5-hydroxy-3,4- 
benzpyrene in ethanol, transformed from the paper 
of Fieser and Hershberg (4)- This obviously is 
signally different from that of the metabolic hydroxy- a long cell is used (5 to io cm.) very low dilutions, 
of the order of i  io -G molar, may be accurately mea- 
sured in the case of unsaturated polycyclic hydro- 
carbons. 
CRYSTALLOGRAPHIC MEASUREMENTS 
Crystallographic measurements were made on several 
preparations of different degrees of purity of crystal- 
line methylated BPX and also of the methoxy deriva- 
tives obtained by reductive methyladon of both the 
synthetic quinones and the red product from the 
feces. In these, three crystallographic species only

could be distinguished: methylated BPX, 5,8-di- 
methoxy-3,4-benzpyrene, and 5,io-dimethoxy-3,4-benz- 
pyrene (Table I and Fig. 5). 
MORPHOLOGICAL AND OPTICAL EXAMINATION

and methylated BPX. A small proportion of crystals 
similar to these, and probably to be identified with 
them, occurred in the preparation of the 5,8- fraction 
from the synthetic mixture obtained by fractional 
sublimation. 
Methylated BPX and 5,8-dimethoxybenzpyrene crys- 
tallize in fine needles, which can be distinguished by 
morphological and optical examination, as indicated 
in Table I and Fig. 5- They are, however, so similar 
that some doubt was felt about their nonidentity until 
x-ray measurements were carried out. The crystals of the mixed methylated quinone preparation. Photo- 
graphs were later obtained from the dimethoxybenzpy- 
rene prepared from the red product of the feces, and 
these proved to be identical with those of the synthetic 
5,8- compound. 
The crystal structures of methylated BPX and 5,8- 
dimethoxybenzpyrene are similar and are of an in- 
teresting and complex triclinic variety. The simplest 
unit cell contains four molecules, but for ease of 
measurement the structure has been referred to a 
larger unit, in which the angles between crystal axes 

x56 Cancer Research 
approximate to right angles and the a and c axes are 
practically indistinguishable in length. The near iden- 
tity in the two cell dimensions extends to the in- 
tensities of corresponding x-ray reflections, and sug- 
gests that the arrangement of the molecules in the b 
plane has symmetry which is destroyed in the crystal 
structure as a whole by staggering of the planes. 
The unit cell dimensions may be given as shown in 
Table II. The cell dimensions are probably correct to widen the permitted limits for the measured molecu- 
lar weight. But the good agreement between Moalc. 
and Mth .... proves clearly that methylated BPX is a 
monomethoxybenzpyrene, while it confirms the di- 
methoxy character of the quinone derivative. 
The fact that the crystal structures of methylated 
BPX and 5,8-dimethoxybenzpyrene are so similar 
is presumably correlated with the presence of the 
methoxy group in methylated BPX at the same posi-

z to 2 per cent. Since in the case of methylated BPX 
only small quantities of material were available, the 
crystal densities were determined by flotation in drops 
of solutions of known densities under the microscope, 
as in the case of BPX itself (3)' Three solutions, of 
densities T.332 , 1.36T , and 1.396, were prepared and 
the behavior of the crystals in these liquids is indi- 
cated in Table II. Meale. in these figui-es is derived 
from the best values of the unit cell dimensions and 
the outside limits for the density. Possible experi- 
mental errors in the x-ray measurements certainly tion as one of those in the dimethoxy compound. That 
this should be the 8- rather than the 5- position is in 
good agreement with the observations made on BPX 
itself (3). 
DISCUSSION 
The evidence of the foregoing results leads to the 
following conclusions: (a) the nonidentity of methyl- 
ated BPX with the methoxy compounds derived from 
benzpyrene-quinones; (b) the identity of the methoxy 
compound derived from the red product from the

benzpyrene; and (c) the allocation of the hydroxy 
group in BPX to the 8- position. crystal structure are all different, while both the 
analytical data for methoxy groups and the x-ray 
measurements agree in establishing that the former

(a) Methylated BPX clearly differs from any of the 
methoxy compounds derived from the synthetic quin- 
ones, since its fluorescence and absorption spectra and is a mono- and the latter are dimethoxy derivatives of 
benzpyrene. From this it is evident that BPX itself 
is a monohydroxybenzpyrene, in confirmation of the 
findings of Chalmers and Crowfoot (3)" 
(b) The identity of the red product from the feces 
with 3,4-benzpyrene-5,8-quinone, already suggested by 
its general properties (~), is established by the identity 
of the fluorescence aL;d absorption spectra and the 
crystal structures of their methylated derivatives, and 
by the demonstration that the methylated derivative 
of the 5,xo-quinone possesses entirely different spectra 
and crystalline form. 
(c) Since on oxidation BPX yielded a red substance 
which, on reductive methylation, produced a methoxy 
compound indistinguishable from the 5,8-methoxy- 
benzpyrene, it may be concluded that BPX itself is 
either 5-hydroxy- or 8-hydroxybenzpyrene, and that 

~5 8 Cancer Research 
an intermediate 5,8-dihydroxybenzpyrene stage is prob- 
ably involved in the conversion. (The difficulty of 
isolating this intermediate product is understandable, 
in view of the observed instability in air of the reduc- 
tion products of benzpyrene-quinones.) However, 5- 
hydroxybenzpyrene is excluded by the pronounced 
difference between the absorption spectrum of syn- 
thetic 5-hydroxybenzpyrene (4) and that of BPX. 
Further, 5-hydroxybenzpyrene would be expected to 
yield on oxidation a mixture of 5,8- and 5,~o-quinones 
but, as shown above, oxidation of BPX yields entirely 
5,8-quinone. The hydroxy group in BPX is therefore 
allocated to the 8- position. Thus the prediction of 
Cason and Fieser (2), that the hydroxy group in the 
metabolic derivative of benzpyrene is not likely to 
be in the 5- position, is substantiated. 
SUMMARY 
A study has been made of the crystallography and 
the fluorescence and absorption spectra of certain 
derivatives of the two products of 3,4-benzpyrene iso- 
oH 
8-hydroxy-3,4-benzpyrene O 
3,4-benzpyrene-5,8-quinone 
lated from mouse and rat feces, and these data have 
been compared with similar data from comparable 
derivatives of synthetic compounds. By these means it was possible to identify the red 
product with 3,4-benzpyrene-5,8-quinone, and to arrive 
at the conclusion that the fluorescent product BPX is 
8-hydroxy-3,4-benzpyrene.
