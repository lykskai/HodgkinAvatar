The crystal structure of insulin is of interest not only in itself but as 
part of the wider problem of protein structure considered as a whole. The 
early X-ray work on protein fibres gave strong support to the original 
chemical theories of the existence of polypeptide chains as the essential 
backbone of the protein molecule. The comparatively small spacings of 
3-4, 4-5 and 10-11 A which are most prominent on a large section of X-ray 
photographs of the scleroproteins are easily interpretable in terms of a 
fundamental chain structure (Astbury and Woods 1933; Astbury and 
Sisson 1935). It is on the other hand difficult to reconcile a chain structure 
with certain of the physical properties of the globular proteins, par­
ticularly their crystalline form and their behaviour in the ultracentrifuge 
as approximately spherical masses of molecular weight some multiple of 
35,000  (Svedberg 1937 a). Yet there is much evidence, physical as well as 
chemical, th at the two types of protein structure are closely interrelated. 
Certain of the natural protein fibres show X-ray reflexions corresponding 
to very long spacings superimposed on the simple /3 keratin type of fibre 
pattern. These long spacings—up to 300 A in feather keratin (Astbury and 
Marwick 1932), tendon and collagen (Wyckolf and Corey 1936)—are more 
of the order of magnitude of the spacings which define the crystal struc­
ture, i.e. intermolecular distances, in crystals of the soluble proteins. And 
further fibre forms can be obtained from the crystalline proteins, par­
ticularly relevant observations being those on edestin and excelsin (Ast­
bury, Dickinson and Bailey 1935). Several attem pts have been made on 
the theoretical side to reconcile these facts, and two views of protein struc­
ture in particular have been stated in some detail. Astbury has advocated 
a variety of straight chain structures for the different fibre proteins which 
may be coiled into spiral forms or folded in layers in the globular proteins 
(Astbury and others 1935), as also discussed by Pauling and Mirsky (1936),

while D. M. Wrinch (1937a) has shown that the occurrence of an internal 
cyclizing process might lead to the development from polypeptide chains 
of beautifully symmetrical “ cyclol” networks both open and space en­
closing. But on the experimental side many more observations are necessary 
before even these quite different hypotheses can be distinguished, and one 
possible approach seems to be through a more complete X-ray study of 
the crystalline globular proteins.
In recent years it has been possible to obtain X-ray diffraction patterns 
from a considerable number of protein crystals. In most cases these 
patterns have been powder photographs only and can give little more than 
a record that some degree of orderly arrangement of molecules exists in 
the crystals (Fankuchen 1934; Wyckoff and Corey 1935; Magnus-Levy, 
Meyer and Lotmer 1936). So far in three examples only, pepsin (Bernal 
and Crowfoot 1934a), insulin (Crowfoot 1935) andexcelsin (Astbury and 
others 1935), have actual single crystal X-ray diffraction patterns been 
obtained, and in these it is possible to carry the deductions from the 
X-ray analysis a stage further. The first photographs permitted the 
calculation of the actual crystal unit cell size in each case and hence the 
order of magnitude of the protein molecular weight. The crystallographic 
method at this stage cannot fix the exact submultiple of the cell molecular 
weight which is the true protein molecular weight unless controlled by 
chemical or other evidence. In these particular three protein crystals 
the weights found agree very well in order of magnitude with those measured 
by Svedberg, provided th at in pepsin there are six Svedberg units in the 
crystal unit cell, in insulin and excelsin only one. It seems at present 
simplest to refer to the weights found by Svedberg’s method as (approxi­
mately) the weights of the protein molecules themselves, i.e. to the 
Svedberg units as the protein molecules, leaving further work to establish 
possible subdivision.
The coincidence, th at in the case of insulin and excelsin the unit cell 
molecular weight is equal to the protein molecular weight given by the 
ultracentrifuge method, has direct implications for the internal structure 
of the protein molecules themselves. In the first place the symmetry of the 
molecule must be that of the crystal at least to the degree of accuracy 
measured by the available X-ray spectra. This point alone is worth further 
investigation, since the preliminary data indicated trigonal symmetry for 
both insulin and excelsin. Secondly, any distribution of scattering matter 
within the unit cell which can be deduced from the X-ray intensities will 
be that within the actual Svedberg molecule. It is naturally impossible 
in the case of exceedingly complex structures such as these to attempt toThe crystal structure of insulin  581

apply directly ordinary trial and error methods to the analysis of the 
intensities of the X-ray reflexions, but the recent introduction of Patterson 
analysis (Patterson 1934, 1935) does supply at least the possibility of a 
description of the intensity variations in terms of prominent interatomic 
distances within the structure. This method could be applied to study any 
protein crystal from which sufficiently good X-ray reflexions are obtain­
able, and of the three so far examined insulin seemed the most hopeful for 
a trial attem pt, since the crystal structure is simpler than that of pepsin 
and the molecular structure simpler, at least in order of magnitude, than 
that of excelsin. The preliminary data published in 1935  on X-ray diffrac­
tion from single crystals of insulin showed both that the variation of the 
X-ray intensities was perfectly definite and characteristic and also that 
there was, to the eye, no apparent relation between these and any protein 
fibre pattern.
The application of the methods of X-ray crystallography to the problem 
of the crystal structure of proteins has been much hindered experimentally 
by two factors. First, most of the beautiful protein crystals described in 
the literature contain water of crystallization which they lose very readily 
on exposure to the air. Secondly, as work on simpler organic molecules 
has shown, the more complicated is the molecular structure, the smaller 
tends to be the proportion of atoms contributing to any one reflecting plane 
(Robertson 1934). The absolute reflecting power of protein crystals for 
X-rays is therefore generally very weak. As far as the first factor is 
concerned, it has proved possible in the case of insulin to obtain diffraction 
effects from ordinary air-dried crystals. The percentage of water of 
crystallization in such crystals is small and this is not lost on exposure to 
the air. On the contrary, the vacuum-dried crystals prove very hygro­
scopic and rapidly regain to a considerable degree their former weight. 
The second factor is probably that mainly responsible for the failure of the 
earlier attem pts to obtain crystalline diffraction effects from insulin, e.g. 
those of W. H. George (1928), of K. Freudenberg and his co-workers (1930) 
and also of H. Sims and D. A. Scott (1930). These authors all examined 
crystalline powders, from which they could obtain no more than an amor­
phous ring at about 4-5 A, together with diffuse scattering extending out 
from the centre of the photograph to a limit of about 10 A.
This diffuse scattering covers in extent the area of the true crystal 
diffraction effects obtained in 1935 . It is very difficult to distinguish actual 
powder lines in this area even on photographs exposed for from 30-40 
hr. and quite impossible to base any crystal structure determination on 
the lines that can be perceived. For this reason alone one might hesitate

to accept Clarke and Corrigan’s report on the crystal structure of insulin 
based on the finding of long spacings in 1932 . The structure proposed does 
not agree with that given in this paper and no later confirmation of the 
measurements has appeared.* In order to observe discrete and interpret­
able diffraction effects it does seem most desirable, if not always abso­
lutely necessary, to work with comparatively large single protein crystals 
—up to 0-2 mm. in one dimension. The first step in the present crystal 
analysis of insulin was therefore the preparation of such crystals.The crystal structure of insulin  583
Th e crystallization  of in su lin
A sample of crystalline insulin prepared by Messrs Boots Pure Drug 
Co. Ltd. was given for this work by Professor F. L. Pyman. This consisted 
of very minute rhombohedral crystals and a number of attempts at 
recrystallization were made in order to grow larger crystals from these. 
Various methods described in the literature were tried but only one 
recrystallization was successful. This followed a slight modification of 
D. A. Scott’s (1934) later method and the details of the actual experiment 
are as follows:
15-8 mg. of insulin were dissolved in 1  c.c. of w'ater + 1  drop NHC 1.  
Meanwhile 12-5 c.c. of phosphate buffer (Na2 H P 04:KH2 P 04  prepared as 
described by Scott) were diluted with an equal bulk of distilled water and 
warmed to 55° C. To this was added the insulin solution and 2 c.c. of 
acetone and the pH  adjusted to 6-2 by the addition of warm 0-9V NH4 OH. 
The solution was set to cool slowly in a cavity in a copper tank filled with 
water at 55° C. At the end of three days the solution was examined and 
found to contain no crystals. The solution was warmed again, a few drops 
of 0 5 % zinc chloride solution added and the pH  readjusted to 6‘2. There 
was a slight cloudy precipitate, which mainly dissolved on warming. The 
solution was again allowed to cool slowly for three days as before and at 
the end of this time comparatively large crystals were found to have 
formed. These were filtered, washed first with the buffer solution, then 
with distilled water and finally with a little alcohol, and air dried. Thev 
were very faintly discoloured. The main part of the sample was used foi 
a test of the biological activity of the preparation, which was found to be 
24 international units per mg. This shows that these large crystals are 
biologically active insulin.
* It is however possible that the lines found by Clarke and Corrigan indicate that  
the structure now put forward is a pseudo-structure of the real one, or that they  
were dealing with a polymorphic modification.

Morphology  and  optics  of in su l in  : the question  of polymorphism
The crystals prepared as above are shown in the photograph (PI. 9(a)). 
They are essentially very flat rhombohedra, the faces developed being 
probably those of the simple rhombohedron {100}, or giving hexagonal 
indices {1011}. The larger crystals grow unevenly and present the appear­
ance of irregular six lobed stars up to 0-2 mm. across and 0-05 mm. thick. 
The crystals also frequently grow in pairs united at the ends of their 
trigonal axes. There seems no doubt that the crystalline form here is 
essentially that found in Abel’s (1926) first preparation of insulin crystals 
and further very well illustrated by Harington and Scott (1929). When 
viewed along the trigonal axis in convergent light these crystals showed a 
positive uniaxial figure.
Under certain conditions insulin crystallizes in a rather different form, 
needles or prisms, elongated along the trigonal axis and showing rhombo- 
hedral end faces combined with steep trapezohedra (Abel, Geiling, Rouiller, 
Bell and Wintersteiner 1927; cf. Hill and Howitt 1936, p. 51). The m ar­
kedly different appearance of these crystals has suggested polymorphism 
to a number of observers, and as a polymorphic modification would be 
particularly valuable in assisting a structure analysis, a preparation of 
“ needle” insulin was examined by the X-ray method. Two preparations 
were available, kindly supplied by Professor F. L. Pyman. The first con­
sisted of very small crystals, roughly wedge-shaped but partly redissolved 
at the edges, less than 0-05 mm. long. In appearance and in the frequent 
occurrence among them of cross-formed twins these crystals seem identical 
with those described by E. B. Mathews as present in one of the preparations 
of Abel and his co-workers (1927; cf. Hill and Howitt 1936, p. 51). The 
second preparation examined consisted of much larger roughly needle- 
shaped masses up to 0-3 mm. long which extinguished uniformly between 
crossed nicols and which although showing no identifiable crystal faces 
were mainly single crystals (PI. 9(6)). The birefringence in both cases was 
positive. The X-ray examination proved that the same crystal structure 
was present both in these large needle-shaped crystals and in the original 
flat rhombohedral crystals (Crowfoot 1937).
But although these particular different forms of insulin crystals are not 
polymorphs, this possibility still remains for certain other preparations of 
which descriptions appear in the literature. Two, particularly, are the 
crystals having the form of rhombic dodecahedra described by Mathews 
(Abel and others 1927; cf. Hill and Howitt 1936, p. 51) and the dumb-bell 
shaped crystals prepared by Scott (1932). In one recrystallization of

insulin, crystals have however been obtained which simulate both these 
forms and yet seem most probably to be no more than habit variants of 
the rhombohedral crystals. This particular preparation was carried out 
as follows:
10 mg. of needle insulin were dissolved in 1  c.c. of N j6 acetic acid and 
treated with 0*4 c.c. brucine acetate and 0-2 c.c. of 13-5% pyridine. The 
main part of the preparation seemed to be precipitated at this stage and 
the flocculent precipitate was therefore isolated by centrifuging and 
removing the supernatant liquid. It was then dissolved in A / 15 di­
sodium hydrogen phosphate and N/ 6 acetic acid was added to slight tu r­
bidity, as described by Abel. On standing in a refrigerator overnight a 
beautiful crop of very small crystals was obtained.
The crystals consisted mainly of a form showing rhombohedral and 
trapezohedral faces almost equally developed, which gave them at first 
sight the appearance of rhombic dodecahedra. They have, however, 
positive birefringence and trigonal, certainly not cubic, symmetry. Amongst 
these crystals there was a small number showing no rhombohedral faces. 
These were bounded by the basal plane and three trapezohedral faces and 
were partly redissolved, so th at accurate measurement was not possible. 
Many of them were joined end to end, tapering inwards to the join, and they 
then looked very similar to the “ dumb-bell” crystals pictured by Scott. 
These crystals also had positive birefringence and, as in the case of the 
pseudo-rhombic dodecahedra, from this fact and the trigonal symmetry 
there seems no reason to presume the presence of a different crystal struc­
ture. The crystals were unfortunately too small for an X-ray test which 
would be conclusive. And it is of course in any case still possible that both 
Mathews’  cubic and Scott’s “ dumb-bell” crystals are different from either 
of these.
The variation in habit is itself of great interest and worthy of further 
investigation. The small number of experiments so far carried out makes it 
impossible to be certain which of the varying factors, pH, phosphate or 
acetate buffer, or concentration of the different metallic ions, is responsible 
for the effects observed. The X-ray diffraction effects as described below 
appear to correspond to a fairly large-scale structure within the protein 
molecule and it would seem possible to have a certain variation, e.g. in the 
metal concentration within the crystals, which might affect the habit 
without altering the main crystal structure responsible for X-ray diffiac­
tion.
The X-ray photographs of the needle crystals do differ in one respect 
from those of the flat rhombohedral crystals. All show a very much moie

marked “ amorphous” ring at 4-5 A; a ring which is hardly visible on the 
photographs of the rhombohedral crystals. This ring we have come to 
consider characteristic of amorphous protein and its presence here may 
well be due to external imperfection in the crystals. But it may also 
indicate that these crystals contain included amorphous protein, the 
presence of which has itself affected the crystal habit. Of course the 
occurrence of “ amorphous” protein would most probably depend on one 
or other of the factors mentioned above, pH, metal concentration, different 
salts present and so on.
Certain other properties of the rhombohedral insulin crystals lend some 
support to these conclusions. Optically, as mentioned above, the crystals 
are uniaxial, the sign of the birefringence positive. The refractive indices 
of the needle crystals were estimated by the oil-immersion method as e 
slightly < 1-537  and (o slightly > 1-531. An independent direct measure 
of the birefringence gave values between 0-004  and 0-008, most probably 
about 0-007, but exact measurement was difficult, owing to the irregular 
shape of the crystals. On the large rhombohedra, o j appeared much more 
nearly equal to 1-537, and it seems probable th at this is a real difference 
and further indication th at the needle crystals are less perfect than the 
rhombohedra.
As Abel and others (1927) originally showed, the air-dried rhombohedral 
crystals contain water of crystallization which they lose when dried over 100° 
in a vacuum. The vacuum-dried crystals are very hygroscopic and rapidly 
regain moisture on exposure to the air, increasing nearly but not quite to 
their original weight. They then show unimpaired birefringence and give 
sharp X-ray reflexions identical with those of untreated crystals. Check 
analyses of the water content of different samples of insulin are given in 
Table I to compare with the crystal densities. As the measurement of the 
density of protein crystals presents certain problems it will be considered 
next in some detail.
The d en sity  of in su l in  crystals
G. S. Adair and M. E. Adair (1936) have recently shown that in the case 
of the crystalline proteins edestin, horse serum albumin and sheep and 
horse haemoglobin, the density of the crystals varies considerably with the 
medium in which they are suspended. The proteins studied all crystallize 
with a considerable quantity of water of crystallization and the variation 
seems most readily explicable as due to specific changes in the salt con­

centration or proportion of this water. The crystallographic estimation 
of the molecular weight of any protein depends upon the crystal density 
and here it is the density of the crystals in air as employed for X-ray work 
that is required. But all methods of density determination so far available 
for use with small crystals do involve their suspension in different liquid 
media and some care must evidently be exercised to choose media which 
have little or no specific effect on the crystal density. In the case of insulin 
it might be hoped that such effects would be at a minimum owing to the 
very small proportion of water of crystallization present.
Two values for the density of crystalline insulin have been already 
recorded. The figure given by Dr Eyer of 1-315  (Freudenberg 1932) 
(method not named) is significantly higher than th at first found with the 
large rhombohedral crystals used for the X-ray measurements, namely 
1-306  + 0-003  (Crowfoot 1935). The latter value was measured by flotation 
under centrifugal force in aqueous solution containing zinc sulphate and 
zinc chloride. The discrepancy might be due either to a medium effect or, 
as was first thought, to crystallographic imperfections such as inclusions 
in the large crystals which might have given an apparently too low density 
for these crystals.
A more comprehensive test was therefore carried out using three different 
samples of crystalline insulin: the preparations of needle insulin (large 
crystals) and unrecrystallized “ rhombohedral ’  ’  insulin (very small crystals) 
described above, and thirdly the large “ rhombohedral” crystals used for 
the X-ray work.
Four sets of solutions were prepared, each consisting of one liquid of 
density greater than that of the crystals and one of less. In outline the 
method employed has been already described (Bernal and Crowfoot 1934 6) 
and differs slightly in procedure from th at used by Adair and Adair, since 
rather small quantities only of insulin were available. The measurements 
were generally begun by suspending the crystals in a mixture of density 
about 1-315  in a small glass tube, the suspension then being centrifuged 
for from 5— 15  minutes. The low-density solution was then added drop by 
drop and the rise or fall of the crystals under centrifugal force observed 
after each addition. The density of the liquid was measured at the end of 
each centrifuge run by a Westphal balance and sinker and the limits at 
which the crystals just rose or sank in the liquid were recorded. When the 
lower limit had been reached, the high-density liquid was in turn added 
drop by drop in order to pass twice over the equilibrium value of the 
density. With longer centrifuge runs it might have been possible to define 
more closely the limits, but there seemed to be a certain variation in theThe crystal structure of insulin  587

crystal density itself over this range, which made such further precision of 
doubtful value.
The liquids used were as follows:  of which 2 and 4 were chosen following 
their use by Adair and A dair:
1. Zinc sulphate in water ( p = 1-35) and distilled water.
2. Sodium dihydrogen phosphate in water = 1-357) and distilled water.
3. o-dichlorobenzene ( p  —1-309), carbon tetrachloride (p = l- 58) and 
toluene (p = 0-87).
4. Half-saturated ammonium sulphate (p = 1-059) and the same solution 
saturated with sucrose ( p= 1-37).
The results are recorded in Table I.

Of these the sugar solution proved completely unsatisfactory for the 
present method. Adair and Adair record a general rise of observed crystal 
density in sugar solutions and this might be considered to be borne out 
here by the only figures obtained. Actually, under the experimental con­
ditions, these very concentrated solutions seem to form density columns, 
the crystals lodging at different heights in the liquid but neither com­
pletely falling nor rising. Such sugar solutions could probably be employed 
with advantage with a set of sinkers of standard densities but are other­
wise useless.
The mixture of organic liquids was used as some control on the results 
obtained in aqueous solutions. Observed under the microscope the crystals 
seemed to remain untouched and birefringent in this immersion medium. 
Actually, in bulk, both the needle crystals and small rhombohedral crystals 
appeared as cloudy masses and the limits were very difficult to observe, 
though the results obtained do agree approximately with the densities 
measured in other solutions. It is possible that this opacity is caused by 
the presence in these preparations of small amounts of non-crystalline

protein. The large rhombohedral crystals remained clear, and with these 
definite higher densities were observed than in aqueous solution.
The two salt solutions were chosen as solutions containing ions commonly 
present during the crystallization of insulin, though different in the two 
examples. The phosphate solution in particular appeared to be reliable 
from the results of Adair and Adair. The densities found in both agree in 
showing a small general variation among the different samples, the needle 
crystals having the lowest, and the large rhombohedral crystals the 
highest, density. This effect is also observed in the organic liquids and 
bears out the indications from other sources (X-ray work and refractive 
index) th at the needle crystals are the least perfect of the three preparations. 
It therefore seems most reasonable to adopt the results on the large rhom­
bohedral crystals as most reliable, particularly as these were used for the 
X-ray work.
The observed densities of the rhombohedral crystals considered alone 
show definite variations with the immersion medium from 1-312  in the 
organic liquids to 1-301  in the salt solutions. These differences are con­
siderably smaller than many of those found with the heavily hydrated 
protein crystals studied by Adair and Adair and suggest that, though 
some specific medium effect is present, it is relatively unimportant. This 
idea receives some support from the absence of correlation between crystal 
size and density among the different insulin preparations studied. In the 
circumstances it is obviously impossible to assign a “ tru e” value to the 
crystal density, but it is very improbable th at any error is introduced by 
adopting a density of 1-298-1*316  for the purposes of molecular weight 
determination. Crystallographic practice would prefer the higher density 
as most likely to be correct.The crystal structure of insulin  589
Th e X - ray  measurem ents
The first X-ray photographs of insulin were taken at Oxford using 
throughout copper radiation from a Philips’  Metallix research X-ray tube. 
These were given exposure times of 15 hr. for each oscillation of 5°, 
with a plate to crystal distance of 6 cm. Four different crystals were used, 
one rotating about the normal to (1010), one about the normal to (1120) 
and two about the trigonal axis. The rhombohedral character of the 
symmetry was first tested by single oscillation photographs about these 
three axes and by oscillation photographs taken at 60° and 120' to each 
other about the trigonal axis. The required relations were found to hold 
without exception, namely (using hexagonal indices) hikl is absent if

h —  k + l is not divisible by three and the symmetry relation 
Using this last identity, a record of the intensities of planes of all the 
different possible types of indices was obtained by a set of 5° oscillation 
photographs covering 60° of the total rotation about the trigonal axis. 
This gave in all but a few cases two readings for the intensity of each 
index type.
Through the kindness of Dr Muller, a second set of X-ray photographs 
of insulin were later taken with the very much more powerful 5 kW tube 
at the Davy-Faraday laboratory. The best photographs were obtained with 
chromium radiation at a voltage of 28 kV, tube current 150 m A  and tube 
filament 8 amp. at 12 V. The X-ray tube had a lithium window. A fine slit 
system nearly 6 cm. long was employed and the very powerful X-ray beam 
shielded from the plate by a stop designed by Dr Muller consisting of a 
lead block 1 mm. across at the end of a cylindrical tube 5 mm. long which 
was suspended 2 cm. from the crystal. Under these conditions it was 
possible to cut down enormously the exposure times required to obtain 
diffraction effects. The photographs were taken of a single crystal rotating 
about the normal to (1010). For more accurate measurement of the cell 
dimensions, two symmetrical photographs were taken, one with the beam 
from 10° to parallel to the trigonal axis and one at right angles to this. 
For these, the plate to crystal distance was 6 cm. To give further readings 
of the intensities of the X-ray reflexions, a set of 15° oscillation photo­
graphs at a plate distance of 4 cm. was then made, each having only f  hr. 
exposure. The photograph reproduced (PI. 9(c)), covering the oscillation 
with the beam 0-10° from parallel to (1210), was, however, given 2 hr. 
and records on a single plate all planes of the type hiko which were 
observed.
Of the needle crystals of insulin, three X-ray photographs only were 
taken of two different crystals. In both cases these were 5° oscillations 
about the normal to (1010) with the beam direction at the start either 
parallel or perpendicular to (1210). These were taken at Oxford with 
copper radiation. One photograph was taken of a rhombohedral crystal 
which had been dried and then allowed to regain water from the air. This 
was also a 5° oscillation about the normal to ( 1010 ), beam direction 
perpendicular to (1210).

as the photograph reproduced illustrates, no planes of symmetry. The 
space group is thus BS.
The cell molecular weight calculated from the above figures and a density 
of T 312 is 39,700. It may be as high as 40,800  or less probably as low as 
38,700. The actual molecular weight of protein in the cell depends on the 
water of crystallization present. Abel’s original measurements on drying 
the crystals at 104° under reduced pressure gave an average value of 
5-35 %, and this is borne out by estimations on certain of the crystals used 
(p. 588). This protein molecular weight may therefore be calculated as 
37,600  (limits 38,900, 36,000).
It is clear from these measurements that the crystal unit cell of insulin 
contains one “ molecule” on the Svedberg scale, but it is interesting to 
compare the figures obtained above more exactly with those found by the 
ultracentrifuge method. The first determination by Svedberg and Sjogren 
(Svedberg 1931; Sjogren and Svedberg 1931) gave 35,100  as the molecular 
weight of insulin, but it is probable th at here, as in most of the earlier 
experiments with the ultracentrifuge, true sedimentation equilibrium was 
not obtained. A later re-estimation (unpublished work by A. G. Poison 
(Svedberg 1937 b) gives a value of 40,900, which is somewhat higher than 
the calculated weight of protein in the crystal unit cell of insulin, 37,600. 
It is doubtful whether this difference between the X-ray and ultracentri- 
fuge results is outside the limits of the experimental error of both series of 
measurements, and the same may probably be said with reference to the 
shape of the “ molecule” , which is spherical according to Svedberg’s deter­
mination, while the unit cell is a markedly oblate spheroid. It may be that 
this last deviation is due to further hydration of the protein in solution, 
since it is already partly hydrated in the crystal (cf. the calculation by 
Adair and Adair on haemoglobin). Such hydration would also alter the 
density of the moving particle which is introduced in Svedberg s equations, 
but this should not necessarily affect the deduction of the actual protein 
molecular weight. The corrections to be applied in such a molecular weight 
measurement either for a change of density or for the non-spherical nature 
of the falling particle seem definitely smaller than the present experimental 
error.
I t should be pointed out that while the mass of protein in the unit cell 
is equivalent to that of one Svedberg unit, the X-ray data do not actually 
supply any evidence that this mass constitutes a single molecule in the

crystal. The same relation to the Svedberg unit would be obtained by the 
presence in the crystal unit of 3 nc hemical molecules which subsequently 
combined in solution to form a single aggregate.

The relative intensities of the X-ray reflexions were estimated by eye 
and assigned values on an arbitrary numerical scale. The scale intervals 
were checked by comparisons between the a and / reflexions from different 
planes and also against a plate on which one X-ray spot had been exposed 
for different measured lengths of time. These estimated intensities were 
corrected by the Lorentz and polarization factors and also, when not 
occurring on the equatorial line, according to the relation found by Cox 
and Shaw (1930), in order to give a set of numerical readings for each plane, 
F'2 proportional to F2 . Both the set of photographs—oscillations about 
perpendicular to (1010)—taken at the Davy-Faraday laboratory and the 
oscillation photographs about [0001] taken at Oxford were used in pre­
paration of the values finally adopted. In the first case comparison between 
different plates was made mainly by assuming equal exposure, generally 
checked by overlapping spectra. In the second case many of the exposures 
were obviously of different value and here the comparison was based mainly 
on the occurrence on every film of some reflexion of the type As all 
hiko reflexions occurred together on another plate their interrelation was 
easily found. In all but two cases of weak reflexions (missed in one series 
or the other through a small degree of missetting) there were at least two 
occurrences of every index type and generally more. Good agreement was 
found between the different values of F'2 assigned to the same reflexion 
occurring on different photographs and also on different layer lines of the 
same photograph. The last, particularly, is some evidence that the relative 
scale of intensities is fairly correct. The values finally adopted are listed 
in Table II.

The set of intensities of X-ray reflexions from insulin recorded above 
have certain characteristics which must be taken into account in their 
analysis. In the first place they are a very limited series—only 59 terms 
in all. No reflexions have been observed from planes with a spacing smaller 
than 7-05 A, and at this distance the intensity is extremely weak. There 
seems to be a definite termination of the series in this region. There should

therefore, for syntheses formed with these terms, be none of the errors 
ordinarily introduced by arbitrarily cutting short the series. On the other 
hand it is impossible to expect to obtain information from this set of 
intensities about the most intimate structure of insulin—actual distances 
between neighbouring atoms. The X-ray reflexions observed must corre­
spond to distances between scattering masses of a fairly large-scale 
structure within the molecule.

To obtain a picture of all the information th at can be derived, without 
any working hypotheses directly from these X-ray reflexions, a series of 
Patterson-Fourier syntheses was prepared using the arbitrary F 2  values 
recorded above as coefficients of the terms. In these two-dimensional 
diagrams the distances of the various peaks from the origin measure in 
length and direction prominent interatomic distances in the structure. The 
first diagram, fig. 1, was formed using only the intensities of the hiko 
reflexions. This gives a projection of the whole Patterson structure on the 
(0001) plane. Owing to the presence of the rhombohedral lattice the primary 
pattern repeats at ^, § and f , 3. The peaks at these positions correspond to 
distances between atoms at z — ^ and § respectively and have neces-

at zero distance from itself. The remaining diagrams illustrated are 
essentially sections cut through the structure along different lines. To form 
these the F '2 values of all (hikl)  planes were used, as first described by

was carried out by the method of Beevers and Lipson (1936a, 6) using the 
strips supplied by them. As it was evident from the number of terms in­
volved th at no very fine structure could be found, the points in the pro­
jections were calculated at intervals of -^a (c  2*5 A) and y^c (2 A). The 
contour lines are drawn at intervals of 50 units in projection 1 and 500 
units in the remaining projections, those in negative regions being dotted. 
As in most cases the slopes involved are very gradual, the choice of the 
exact areas bounded by the contour lines is somewhat arbitrary and these 
should not be given a too rigid interpretation.
Between them these five diagrams present a fairly complete survey of 
what maybe called—as above—the Patterson structure of insulin. Owing to 
the rhombohedral symmetry, the diagrams, figs. 2 and 3, sections cut parallel 
to (0001) at 0 and |,  actually supply sections of the structure in this direc­
tion at intervals of z = the distribution at the point f, in fig. 2, being,
for example, the same as th at at 0 at a height of z |, and so on. Some 
check on the interreliability of the intensity data can be obtained by 
addition of the density values derived from points on these two projections 
2 and 3 at 2 intervals of |  and then comparing the picture formed with 
projection 1, since projection 1  is derived from only reflexions and the 
others from all hikl reflexions. The agreement is fairly good, and even 
better over the lines AB and AC, where density values have been calculated 
at intervals of z = Tt-
The peak structure shown by the five projections seems comparatively 
simple. There are two main series of peaks (A and B), one at a distance of 
10 A from the origin parallel to (0001) and the other at about 22 A mea­
sured similarly. These peaks have considerable extension at right angles 
to (0001), the main intensity maxima appearing some distance above and 
below the height z = 0. There is further a marked peak at x = 0, = 0,
z = 0*5 (D), and a considerably weaker series, of which defining co-ordinates 
may be given as x =  0-29, y = 0-19, z = 0 (C). Owing to the poor resolution 
and overlapping it is impossible to pretend to any accuracy in assigning 
positions to the different peaks, and it seems probable that to a large 
degree their irregular outlines are due to their composite character and 
should be taken into account in their interpretation. Approximately, 
however, the co-ordinates of the main peaks may be recorded as in Table 
III, which gives one selection of peaks which by repetition according to 
rhombohedral symmetry would produce the whole Patterson structure. 
It is of course possible that some other selection might be made which 
would throw more light on the real molecular structure.
In order to pass from the Patterson structure to the molecular structure
 Downloaded from https://royalsocietypublishing.org/ on 19 February 2025 

it is necessary to reduce the peak system shown in the Patterson diagrams 
to its simplest terms. Certain interatomic distances which appear must be 
derived from others in real space. The patterns found are comparable in 
simplicity with those obtained in molecular structures of quite small 
dimensions, e.g. those of pentaerythritol (Llewellyn, Cox and Goodwin 
I937), where the peaks represent distances between single atoms. At first 
sight they suggest th at here we might be dealing with masses about 10 A, 
across which simulate the properties of single atoms in simpler structures. 
But even assuming the presence of such masses it has not so far proved 
possible to offer a derivation of the Patterson diagrams in terms of an 
actual molecular arrangement. And the problem may, of course, be much 
more complicated, each peak being the result of a comparatively small 
proportion of scattered interatomic distances. Some measure of the 
absolute value of the intensities of the X-ray reflexions, which will next 
be undertaken, may offer an easier approach to a solution.

Gen eral  conclusions  : th e Patterson  analysis  of 
in su l in  and  pr o tein  structure
Even without the derivation of a molecular structure for insulin from the 
Patterson analysis, certain conclusions relevant to the main problem of 
protein structure may be drawn. The first question raised at the beginning 
of this paper was th at of a check on existing theoretical speculations. It 
must be said that the patterns calculated do not appear to have any 
direct relation either to the cyclol or to the various chain structures put 
forward for the globular proteins. From the cyclol .structure (Wrinch 
1937 6) one would expect many more peaks in the Patterson synthesis than 
do actually occur. For example, besides peaks at about 10 A parallel to

598 D. Crowfoot
(0001) there should also be peaks at 5 and 15 A. It is less easy to control 
the folded-chain hypotheses, as for these no exact models have yet been 
calculated, but in outline the picture does not suggest a chain structure. 
There is no indication in the diagrams of layers parallel to (0001) as some 
theories would require, and the idea of a spiral chain which has otherwise 
some attraction does not, at least in its general form, account for the 
definite distribution of 10 and 20 A interatomic distances in separate 
peaks. I t is naturally difficult to rely on these conclusions without still 
more exact theories involving the actual positions of the different amino- 
acid residues in the protein molecule. But the general lack of positive 
agreement remains evident.
Perhaps the most unexpected information derived from the preliminary 
data on insulin was, as mentioned above, th at the unit of weight about 
39,000 had apparently trigonal symmetry. This may be considered to 
receive some support from the chemical analyses of several proteins by 
M. Bergmann and C. Niemann (1937), who find th at the amino-acid 
residues constantly recur in multiples of three. The most natural explanation 
of trigonal symmetry is th at the Svedberg unit is actually an aggregate of 
3 n chemical molecules. I t is a priori  less likely th at a molecule of such 
magnitude should possess real trigonal symmetry, though it should perhaps 
be pointed out th at this is actually developed by the cyclol theory. It is, 
however, doubtful whether the facts justify pushing this argument further. 
The new experimental evidence is still unable to exclude the possibility 
th at the trigonal symmetry shown by the crystal and the diffraction effects 
is due to statistical twinning and hence is not a property of the Svedberg 
“ molecule” itself. And even apart from this reservation, the present 
examination shows that a somewhat less rigid interpretation of the facts 
is possible. It still seems necessary to postulate an approximately trigonal 
distribution of masses within the Svedberg unit, but this distribution need 
not extend to atomic dimensions. Irregularities of the order of 1  or 2 A 
would plainly not be indicated by the observed diffraction effects. It was 
hoped that more powerful X-ray apparatus would reveal a finer structure, 
but such if present did not appear on the exposures taken with the Davy- 
Faraday 5 kW tube. And it is at least plausible that the very definite 
cutting short of the series of reflexions at spacings from 8-7 A is a positive 
indication that there are irregularities within the structure below this 
limit (see below).
The most interesting fact that has emerged from the Patterson analysis 
is the very definite distribution in space of groups of interatomic distances 
above this limit of 7 A, particularly those of approximately 10-12 A and
 Downloaded from https://royalsocietypublishing.org/ on 19 February 2025 

22 A. The appearance of these sets of distances immediately relates the 
internal structure we are examining in insulin with the diffraction effects 
previously observed in other proteins, both fibrous and crystalline. We 
may connect these 10-11 A and 22 A distances with the spacings com­
monly observed in denatured protein crystals such as pepsin and edestin 
(Astbury 1934) and even proteins such as gelatin (Gerngross, Herrmann 
and Abitz 1930). The 10-11 A distance then appears identical with Ast- 
bury’s “ side chain” spacing in keratin or myosin. And this is supported by 
a striking relationship between these X-ray results for insulin and those 
on excelsin. According to the preliminary measurements of Astbury, 
Dickinson and Bailey (1935), excelsin crystallizes in a rhombohedral 
structure with one molecule in the unit cell, not unlike that of insulin, 
though the scale is much greater. The crystals of excelsin examined had, 
however, been kept for some time, which resulted in partial degeneration, 
and the diffraction patterns obtained showed, besides true crystal X-ray 
reflexions, an oriented fibre pattern. With the X-ray beam perpendicular 
to the basal plane this took the form of six blurred sickles with spacings 
of 1T4 A around the trigonal axis, while at right angles the fibre reflexion 
had a spacing of roughly 4-5 A. The orientation of the 11-4 A spacing of 
the excelsin fibre pattern parallel to the crystal basal plane is the same as 
that of the 10-11 interatomic distances in insulin. Arfd these consequently 
supply further evidence of the close relationship between the actual inter- 
molecular structures of the fibre and globular proteins. It is difficult not 
to connect these spacings also with the intramolecular patterns obtained 
from the virus proteins. From these Bernal and Fankuchen (1937) have 
been led to deduce the presence of submolecules 20 x 20 x 22 A, which are 
again divided into nearly identical units of half these dimensions. But 
whether these spacings of 10 and 20 A, which occur in all these different 
types of proteins, are actually due to distances between chains held apart 
by their side groups, as Astbury advocates, remains still to be proved. 
The evidence of the ultracentrifuge measurements, which show a reversible 
dissociation of insulin outside the pH  stability range 4*5-7, may perhaps 
be quoted as some support for an alternative hypothesis that they are due 
to definite massive subdivisions within the protein molecule. Whatever 
their explanation, the Patterson analysis of insulin provides a first exact 
description of their vectorial distribution in space.
The identification of these 10 A spacings in insulin raises the problem of 
the occurrence of the second generally found protein spacing of 4*5 A. The 
crystal diffraction effects observed in insulin which end at 7 A can give no 
information as to the origin of the 4*5 A ring found on the powder photo­The crystal structure of insulin  599

graphs. Yet this ring must be due to the internal structure of the protein. 
The intensity of reflexion at any angle depends upon the product of what 
may be called the atomic and molecular scattering factors at th at angle. 
And accordingly with a perfectly ordered protein crystal one might expect 
recurrence of sharp diffraction effects in the region of 4-5 A, which would be 
of particular importance for a study of the most intimate structure of the 
protein molecule. Their absence in insulin suggests on this reasoning some 
actual disorientation of atoms within the molecule, rather than mutual 
disorientation of the protein molecules. But either effect might be caused 
by the processes involved in the preparation of the crystals and their 
present physical condition. And in this case it is reasonable to hope for 
results on other protein crystals which will carry the X-ray analysis deeper 
into the problem of their structure.

Summary
X-ray crystallographic measurements show th at insulin crystallizes in the 
rhombohedral system, space group R3. The dimensions of the unit cell are 
a = 44-4 A, a = 114° 48' or, referred to hexagonal axes, 74-8, c = 30*9 A 
correct to about 0-5 %. The densities of three samples of crystalline insulin 
have been measured in four different immersion media and show small 
variations between values of 1-292  and 1-316. From these and the cell 
dimensions the unit cell molecular weight may be calculated as most 
probably 39*700  (maximum 40,800, minimum 38,700). The crystals contain 
water which they lose when dried at 104° in a vacuum and this has been 
estimated at 5-35%. The molecular weight of protein in the unit cell is 
hence calculated as 37,600  (38,900-36,000), which is of the order of magni­

tude though rather less than the molecular weight of insulin found by 
Svedberg. There is, however, no crystallographic evidence that this weight 
constitutes a single molecule.
The intensities of all the X-ray reflexions that could be observed from air- 
dried single crystals of insulin have been estimated visually and are recorded 
as terms proportional to F2. From these terms a series of Patterson-Harker 
Fourier syntheses has been formed which shows the distribution of the 
main interatomic distances within the insulin molecule. The patterns 
correspond to a fairly large scale structure and as such cannot give informa­
tion on the placing of individual atoms or as to whether the trigonal 
symmetry shown is necessarily carried to atomic dimensions. The most 
im portant interatomic distances th at appear are at 10 and 22A roughly 
parallel to the basal plane. I t is suggested that these are related to the 
characteristic X-ray spacings of many proteins both globular and fibrous, 
and the virus proteins.The crystal structure of insulin  601
