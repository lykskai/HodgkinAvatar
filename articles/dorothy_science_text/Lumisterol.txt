887. A Crystallographic Examination of the Structure 
Lumisterol. of 
By DOROTHY CROWFOOT HODGKIN and D. SAYRE. 
Most of the stereochemical features of the molecule of lumisterol have 
been elucidated by an X-ray diffraction study of the crystal structure of 
lumisteryl 4-iodo-3-nitrobenzoate. The configuration deduced earlier is 
confirmed for positions 3, 9, 10, 13, 14, and 17, with rings A and c in the chair 
form and rings c and D trans-fused. As proposed on chemical evidence, the 
change from the ergosterol structure that has occurred is inversion at C(l,,). 
But the retention of the chair form of ring A requires also a change of orient- 
ation of the &-OH bond from a direction nearly parallel with the nucleus 
to one approximately at right angles to it (K--E in Hassel's notation). 
THE present study is the third in a series of sterol crystal structure determinations carried 
out in this laboratory, the previous two compounds examined having been cholesteryl 
iodide (Carlisle and Crowfoot, Proc. Roy. Soc., 1945, A, 184, 64) and calciferyl 4-iodo-3- 
nitrobenzoate (Crowfoot and Dunitz, Nature, 1948, 162, 608). Lumisterol (11) was selected 
for study as one of the group of compounds found during the photochemical transformation 
of ergosterol (I) into calciferol (111). Chemical evidence (Dimroth, Ber., 1936, 69, 1123 ; 
Kennedy and Spring, J., 1939, 250) had indicated that, in the case of lumisterol, the trans- 
formation involved inversion at (&), and this has been confirmed by the present 
investigation.

The compound chosen for X-ray analysis, lumisteryl 4-iodo-3-nitrobenzoate, was very 
kindly prepared for us by Dr. J. W. Cornforth. It crystallised in three different forms, of 
which two appeared to be solvated. The third, which was the one studied in detail, occurs 
in pale yellow, solvent-free prisms. Preliminary crystallographic data on these crystals 
may be summarised as follows :

yellow, monoclinic prisms, (OOl), (101) slightly elongated along the b axis. Optically

Structure AnaZysis.-The X-ray analysis was a straightforward application of the heavy- 
atom technique. From the b axis projection of the Patterson function (Fig. 1) the x and z 
co-ordinates of the iodine atoms were found directly. On account of the crystal symmetry, 
the y co-ordinates of one atom can be arbitrarily chosen and the co-ordinates of the iodine 
atoms in the crystal could be given as : x = + 0.267, y = 
By using signs based on the contributions of the iodine atoms alone and the observed 
structure factors, a first electron-density projection was calculated along the b axis. This 
projection is centrosymmetric, the structure factors are real, and the signs appropriate to 
the structure factors are very largely those based on the contributions of the iodine atom 
alone. The first b-axis projection accordingly approximates closely to a correct represent- 
ation of the electron density (Fig. 2). Unit-cell dimensions : a = 10.55, b = 7.63, c = 20.57 A, p = 93.5".

Although most of the individual atomic positions are unresolved, it proved possible to 
recognise the molecule in this first projection and to correlate the several concentrations of 
electron density with definite portions of the lumisterol structure. Study of models showed 
that of the different possible stereochemical forms of the sterol skeleton only one possessed 
the general features demanded by this projection. Thus the main line of peaks across the 
centre of the cell must correspond with the sterol nucleus, viewed edge on, while the nitro- 
benzoate group projects nearly at right angles to this line with the plane of the benzene ring

whole, and the presence on opposite sides of the nucleus of two peaks which can hardly be 
other than the 18- and 19-methyl groups, establish the configurations at the asymmetric

of the nucleus establishes the configuration at C(,l, the chair form of ring c, and the con- 
figuration at (&, i.e., the trans-fusion of rings c and D. Finally the general location of the 
side chain establishes the configuration C(l,). and also the chair form of ring A.

The remaining calculations were carried out mainly as a further check on the atomic 
arrangement deduced at this stage. The b-axis projection was refined once, but little 
change occurred. The non-centrosymmetrical a-axis projection was then calculated with 
signs based, in the first instance, on the iodine positions only. Since the distribution of the 
iodine atoms is, by itself, centrosymmetrical, these signs correspond to a centrosymmetrical 
electron-density distribution. The a projection, as first calculated, accordingly possesses a 
spurious centre of symmetry and corresponds approximately to the correct projection of the 
two molecules in the unit cell, superimposed on those of two mirror-image molecules (Fig. 3a). 
Examination showed that it had the appearance expected of overlapping sterol molecules 
viewed along a line roughly at right angles to the plane of the ring systems. Tbemodel

of the molecule which had been obtained from the b-axis projection was therefore placed 
over this second projection in the manner which seemed best to account for the observed 
electron-density maxima. From the tentative atomic positions thus obtained, phases 
were calculated and the non-centrosymmetrical distribution, Fig. 3b, was derived. This 
distribution confirms very satisfactorily the proposed structure on which it was based. 
By the further use of models projected over the latest a and b electron-density projections 
together, the set of atomic co-ordinates listed in the Table was derived. We lay no claim 
to accuracy of these co-ordinates in detail. The validity of the molecular structure they 
define rests principally on its agreement with the general character of the projections 
observed, particularly the b-axis projection, but it is supported also by structure-factor 
calculations based on these co-ordinates. The reliability indices found were R = 26% for 
(hO2) structure factors and R = 21y0 for (Okl) structure factors. 
The chemical form of the molecule deduced is illustrated by (11) and Fig. 4, which refer 
to the sterol portion of the structure only. The relations between the different asymmetric

centres in the nucleus are those derived from chemical arguments as illustrated in (11). 
In addition rings A and c are in the chair form. The evidence obtained for the arrangement 
of atoms in the side chain is less strong than that for the nucleus. It confirms the con- 
figuration at C(,,) found for cholesterol and calciferol but appears to contradict the con- 
figuration for Cs,,) tentatively proposed for calciferol (Crowfoot and Dunitz, Zoc. cit.). 
However, the evidence obtained for this configuration, both here and with calciferol, is not 
conclusive and this detail remains in doubt. 
There are a number of interesting points about the crystal and molecular structure. 
As expected, the stereochemical difference between lumisterol and ergosterol is in the 
change of the 19-methyl group from the p- to the a-position. This change is associated 
with a rearrangement in the packing of the neighbouring atoms in ring A. The chair form 
is retained in ring A, through alternate puckering of the carbon atoms of the ring system 
from that likely in ergosterol. As a result the C,)-OH bond, which in ergosterol presum- 
ably lies near the general plane of the molecule (K-bond in the notation of Hassel, Tidsskr. 
Kjemi, 1943, 3, 32) is rotated to a position approximately normal to the molecular plane

epi-configuration first proposed for lumisterol to account for its similarity to ePicholestero1 
in the digitonin precipitation reaction.

[ 19521 Examination of the Structure of Lumisterol. 
The change of orientation of the hydroxyl group in lumisterol is a consequence of the 
preferred arrangement of the atoms of ring A in the staggered chair form of the cyclohexane 
ring. The situation is parallel with that found in cis-decalin (Bastiansen and Hassel, 
Nature, 1946,157, 765) and probably also in the choleic acids * and, as in these cases, results 
in the production of a very awkwardly shaped molecule. However, the overall shape of 
the molecule of lumisteryl4-iodo-3-nitrobenzoate is completely masked in the preliminary 
crystallographic data through the intricate way in which the large substituent groups are 
fitted between the ends of the sterol ring systems. The molecular arrangement is deter- 
mined by the relative packing of the main part of the sterol nuclei and side chains of neigh- 
bouring molecules in a way exactly similar to that expected for normal steroids and this is 
reflected in the unit-cell dimensions, which are very similar to those of many normal 
steroid crystal structures. The crystal refractive indices, on the other hand, are largely 
controlled by the orientation of the substituent nitrobenzoate group and do not conform 
tb the normal type of relation to the cell dimensions (Bernal, Crowfoot, and Fankuchen, 
Phil. Trans. Roy. SOC., 1940, A, 139, 135). 
These observations emphasise the difficulty of drawing conclusions about certain types 
of stereochemical configuration from preliminary X-ray data and suggest a resolution of an 
apparent conflict in the literature between present theory and early crystallographic data on 
coprostane, which has been discussed by Shoppee (Ann. Reports, 1946,43,200) and by Turner 
(Fieser and Fieser, " Natural Products related to Phenanthrene," Chap. X, Reinhold 
Publ. Corpn., N.Y.). That coprostane has unit-cell dimensions belonging to one of the 
normal steroid types can easily be accounted for by the lath-like character of the major 
part of the molecule; it does not provide any real evidence of a boat-shaped structure for 
ring A. As in the lumisterol crystal structure, the unit-cell dimensions almost certainly 
conceal the presence in this molecule of the chair form of ring A. 
The mechanism of the trans- 
formation of ergosterol into lumisterol and its relation to the production of calciferol need 
further investigation. Stereochemically, it is unlikely that the 19-methyl group migrates 
directly to the other side of the steroid nucleus; this would involve its passage between 
carbon atoms initially themselves only 2; A apart. Most probably the initial stage is 
rupture between C(lo) and one of the carbon atoms of the ring system; either C,9)TC(Jo,, 
which is certainly broken in calciferol, or C(5)-C(10) t (cf. the production by an irradiation 
reaction of lumioestrone and lumiandrosterone) are likely points of attack. In either case, 
lumisterol itself would then be formed by closure of the ring system in the new stereo- 
chemical configuration. It would not correspond with a definite stage in the transformation 
of ergosterol into calciferol but would be the product of a side-reaction, and would be capable 
itself of undergoing transformation into calciferol. These conclusions are in agreement 
with the early observations of Setz (2. fihysiol. Chem., 1933, 215) that the production of 
lumisterol and calciferol is favoured by light of different wave-lengths, but in detail the 
course of the reactions is still obscure. A final point of a rather different kind may be made.

the further work was done on it. 
Analysis of the original materials by Drs. Weiler and Strauss, Oxford, supported the view 
that this preparation, which largely consisted of form A, m. p. 136.5-137’, contained benzene 
of crystallisation (Found : C, 65.2; H, 7.0; loss at lOO”, 9.9. C3,H4,O4NI,C,H, requires

The intensities of the 
(h0Z) and (OM) reflections were estimated visually from multiple-film Weissenberg photographs ; 
392 out of a possible 564 F(hOZ)’s, and 127 out of a possible 217 F(0KZ)’s were estimated. On 
the edges of these Weissenberg photographs had been recorded the diffraction pattern of a fine 
copper wire, and the unit-cell dimensions were determined wit: the aid of this calibrating 
pattern. 
It was estimated that the 
extremes of X-ray transmission for this crystal were 0.32 and 0.39, and it was decided that this 
variation was not severe enough to make absorption corrections necessary. 
The absolute scales were obtained by correlation with the final calculated F(h0Z)’s and 
F(0Kl)’s. 
Calculations.-The 6-axis Patterson projection (Fig. 1) is a ‘I sharpened ” projection, based 
on the (h0l) intensities divided through by the square of the f curve of iodine with a temperature 
factor B = 3.6 x 10-l6. All Fourier sums were performed with Beevers-Lipson strips and a 
desk adding machine, at intervals of 1/60 along G and 1/30 along a and b. All structure-factor 
calculations were carried out by a technique which reduces structure-factor calculation to 
Fourier series summation (Sayre, Acta Cryst., 1951, 4, 362) and which, it is estimated, required 
only about 1/3 of the usual time. In all the structure-factor calculations CH, was treated as a 
carbon atom of atomic number 9, 0 and CH, as of 8, N and CH as of 7, and C as one of 6. 
Viervoll and @rim’s .f curve (Acta Cryst., 1949, 2, 277) was used for carbon, and that of the 
In the earlier 
calculations a temperature factor B = 3-5 x 10-ls was applied to all atoms ; in the final calculations 
an empirical overall correction curve was used instead, chosen to bring about the best agreement 
between Fobs. and Fcalc. , and approximately equivalent to a temperature correction with X-Ray Measurements.-Cogper-Ka radiation was used throughout.
