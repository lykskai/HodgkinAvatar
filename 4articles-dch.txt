Layer-chain Structures of Thallium Di-Alkyl
Halides
DURING the last year we have been studying the
crystal structures of a series of compounds RaTlX,
which prove to be of some interest in view of the
recent work on the rotation of molecules in crystals.
The dimethyl thallium halides are tetragonal and the
others orthorhombic, pseudo-tetragonal, and aU show a sodium chloride-like structure. Layers of TIX
parallel to the ab plane are spaced out at distances
depending on the length of the alkyl chains, which are attached to the thallium ions perpendicularly to
these layers. The a and b cell dimensions are almost
independent of the alkyl group and vary between
4·29 A. (chloride) and 4·76 A. (iodide). These spacings,
which, except in the case of the iodide, are much lower
than the values 4·85 A. (Miiller) 1 and 4·76 A. (Bernal) 2
found for the distance between rotating chains, are in agreement with other indications that the chains
in these compounds do not rotate.
There is evidence that the chains are not of the
usual zigzag pattern, but are like Muller and Shearer's 3
suggested type 3, and the two covalencies of the
central thallium atom in the chain are at 180°.
We have also studied the double refraction of these
compounds, which combine the characteristics of both
chain and layer structures. The following table shows
that the sign of the double refraction may be either
positive or negative according as the influence of tbe
chain or layer character is the greater (cf. Bernal's
observation, loco cit., of negative double refraction in
an alkyl ammonium chloride). 

The variations can be satisfactorily explained by a simple extension of the method of Wooster,4 by taking
into account the relative importance of the various
atoms in their contribution to the refraction.
A detailed account is in preparation.

Crystal Structure of Vitamin B₁ and of Adenine Hydrochloride

Crystals of vitamin B₁ (hydrochloride) from various sources have been examined. All have been found to be substantially identical in form and X-ray patterns. A very slight difference in optical properties may, however, point to the existence of a variable amount of impurity in solid solution. The angle between the c axis and the principal direction γ is 19° 40' ± 20', 19° 20' ± 20', 19° 20' ± 20', and 19° 9' ± 20' in four specimens prepared respectively by Windaus and Tschesche, Jansen and Donath, and Peters (two specimens separated at different pH). The crystals were monoclinic, tabular on b and slightly elongated along c, showing faces (010), (110), (011), and sometimes (1 KT) and (2 KT). The cell dimensions are: a = 12·62 Å.; b = 20·53 Å.; c = 6·96 Å.; β = 66° 56'. The space group is probably C²ₛ — P2₁/n. Assuming four asymmetric molecules per cell and the measured density 1·43, the molecular weight is 358, in good agreement with 355 calculated from the formula of Windaus: C₁₂H₁₇O₄N₅S, 2HCl. The optical properties are: optic axial plane b, γ is 19° 20' from b in acute angle; optic axial angle large, undetermined, sign probably negative, birefringence high.

Combining the indications, it is possible to form some idea of the size and shape of the molecule. The molecule must be flat, of dimensions some 18 × 10 Å., suggesting conjugated ring structure; they must be nearly in (001) planes and form a double layer parallel to (010). The intensities of reflexions (040)m (060) show that the heavy atoms S, Cl do not both lie at the ends of the molecule. Beyond this it is impossible to go at present, but further work with X-ray data to discriminate between alternatives is needed.

There has been, in recent letters to Nature, the description of the crystal structure of adenine hydrochloride. A close resemblance between the crystals of vitamin B₁ and of adenine hydrochloride has been described. This has provided further evidence that the form of vitamin B₁ is a free base, as indicated by our micrographic investigations. In external form and optical

properties the two crystals are identical. The only difference that could be detected was that the B₁₄ crystals, of which not more than 0·01 mgm. was available, appeared slightly inhomogeneous, one component possibly differing from the others, and from adenine hydrochloride by at most 0·3 per cent in spacings.

The crystals were monoclinic, tabular on c and slightly elongated along b, showing faces (001), (100), (011) and (110). The cell dimensions are
a = 8·71 ± 0·015 Å.; b = 4·80 ± 0·005 Å.; c = 20·00 ± 0·05 Å.; β = 62° 0′. There are four molecules of the hydrochloride and two of water per cell. The space group is probably C⁴₂h — P2₁/c. It may, however, be C⁴₂ — Pc, as some crystals seem hemihedral, though there is no trace of pyroelectricity. In either case the molecules are asymmetric. The optical properties are: optic axial plane b, γ is 8° from b in obtuse angle; optic axial angle medium; sign positive; high birefringence. This is a typical structure for condensed ring molecules arranged in two layers with their principal directions nearly parallel to the axis, and their ring planes inclined 30°–40° out of the (100) planes.

This investigation would seem to suggest that the substance showing B₁₄ activity can only exist as an impurity in the crystals prepared by Peters. There are three possibilities:
(a) The impurity is in the form of an amorphous material adsorbed on the crystals, or it is in solid solution it must either:
(b) Be present in extremely minute quantities; or
(c) Itself be a substance closely allied to adenine hydrochloride.

CRYSTALLOGRAPHY.
CRYSTALLOGRAPHIrCes earch in the last two years has no longer
been primarily concerned with structure determination. The main
types of structure have already been determined, and the more
complicated structures are found ip general to be variations on
simpler types or combinations between them. The prevailing
interest has shifted to the relations between crystal structure and
physical properties, and to relations and transformations between
crystal types. Crystal physics more firmly grounded on quantum
mechanics is widening its scope and becoming increasingly quan-
titative and precise, whilst crystal chemistry is appearing more
and more as the basis on which the chemistry-of the future will
be written. The rational chemistry of metals and ores is a creation
of structural crystallographic methods ; the chemistry of cellulose
and other complex polymerides such as the proteins has through
them made a critical advance.
The appearance of the first volume of “The Crystalline State,”
a general survey by W. L. Bragg, has at last provided an
authoritative, attractive, and simple presentation of the con-
tribution of structure analysis to the problems of physics, chemistry,
biology, and technics. This volume is not intended for specialists
in the field, but should be in the hands of every chemist who wishes
to do original work on modern lines.
Ewald’s new edition of Die Erforschung des Aufbaues der
“
Materie mit Rontgenstralilen furnishes a more theoretical approach
”
to the problem of crystal analysis : it is particularly valuable for
its account of X-ray optics.
The Properties of Cuprous Oxide.-The commercial use of rectifiers
and photocells based on the remarkable properties of semi-conduct-
ing crystalline films of cuprous oxide (cuprite) has drawn much
attention to the electrical and optical behaviour of this substance.
An excellent review of this field until the end of 1932, with copious
references, is given by L. 0. Grondah1,l which leads us to conclude
that the theoretical side of the subject is not as far advanced as the
practical.
Cuprous oxide, as a large single crystal, has a slight electrical
conductivity which appears to depend on the concentration of free

oxygen which it contains.2 When the crystal is illuminated, a,
photoconductivity appears (inner photoelectric effe~t),p~h oto-
electrons are ejected from the surface (outer photoelectric effect)
and a potential difference may be set up between different parts of
the crystal, as if electrons had been carried in the direction of the
light rays (Dember effect). Photoconductivity is, of course, a
usual phenomenon with non-conducting crystals (for a general
review of the subject see F. C. Nix 5, ; the outer photoelectric effect
is well known in metals, but little work seems to have been done on
it for less good conductors.6 The measurement of the photocon-
ductivity is not easy with cuprite, since the normal conductivity
may mask the effect ; recourse has been made to the use of periodic
illumination, allowing the periodic current to be separately ampli-
fied; and to measurements at low temperatures,s at which the
normal conductivity is small. The technique of R. Schultze with
very thin films would also seem to be applicable.
The theoretical pictures of the passage of electrons through feebly -
conducting substances have been developed by R. H. Powler,lo
A. H. Wilson,ll R. W. Gurney l2 and others on the basis of quantum
statistics; and these pictures seem to be accepted as adequate 13
for the explanation of the inner photoelectric effect with insulating
crystals. But Wilson’s theory is dismissed by (Mme.) A. Joff6 and
A. F. Joff6 l4 atEl unable to explain for cuprite either the potential
distribution in the illuminated crystal or the variation of this
potential with intensity of light. It has in fact been questioned
whether, apart from the presence of impurities, semiconductors like
cuprite have any real existence as such.
There seems to be some difference of opinion as to what spectral

range is responsible for the photoconductivity of cuprite : thus
F,. Englehard postulates the excitation of an infra-red absorption
band, while D. Nasledov and L. Nemenov l5 even ascribe the increase
of conductivity on illumination of ordinary cuprite to a heating
effect. Schonwald,' on the other hand, finds definite photoelectric
maxima at wave-lengths of 0.8, 0.63, and 0.2 8. The simultaneous
irradiation of a cuprite photocell with different wave-lengths gave
non-additive effects,16w hile R. Deaglio 1' obtained a marked fatigue
for the Dernber effect after driving a current continuously through
his crystal for six days. The indefiniteness of these data must surely
be ascribed to the significant variation of electrical resistance, and
even of optical absorption, with oxygen content, previously men-
tioned; it is not the pure crystal lattice which has been the subject
of the majority of these experiments. A definite alteration of the
properties of the crystal seems to have taken place after several
experiments.18
The Recti$er.-When the cuprous oxide is in the form of a thin
layer on a basis of metallic copper, additional phenomena make
their appearance. The rectifier discs of commerce are formed by
oxidising pure copper sheet at about 1000" until a layer of oxide
some 0.1 mrn. thick is produced. Different methods of cooling the
discs lead eventually to different characteristics.l*l 9 The super-
ficial high-resistance layer of cupric oxide is removed mechanically
or by solution, and contact with the free surface of the cuprous oxide
is made, e.g., by rubbing it with carbon and pressing against it a
thin lead disc. Such a rectifying unit has strongly asymmetrical
properties; thus it may show an electrical resistance per sq. cm.
with the copper positive, of 10,000 ohms, while with copper negative
the value may be only a few ohms. Currents of the order of 0.1
amp. per sq. cm .-more under special conditions-and permissible
voltages per disc of 10-30 volts allow the construction of cheap and
reliable rectifiers of very wide application.
The theoretical explanation of the rectification is in a very con-
fused state. Though, of course, contact rectification between
crystals and point contacts (e.g., the familiar wireless crystal ',)
"
has long been known, such rectification has always been very local
and precarious. The rectification of the copper-cuprous oxide disc
is definitely located at the interface of the two substances (as we
have seen, cuprous oxide by itself has no marked asymmetric

properties), and it is the constancy of behaviour of this interface,
formed, of course, from the mother copper, and protected from all
contamination, which makes the commercial applications of the
rectifier possible. Grondahl has well summarised the theoretical
position at the end of 1932, and since then there do not seem to have
been any constructive suggestions for the clearing up of the difficul-
ties. The following is a very compressed summary of his discussion.
Attempts have been made to ascribe the rectification to thermo-
electric effects ; to a microscopic point and plane structure ; to
" "
an electrolytic effect due to the presence of a more highly conducting
substance between the crystals of cuprous oxide; in terms of work
functions of the two substances; as due toethe existence of a high-
resistance thin film, deficient in electrons, between oxide and
copper ; as due to a cold electron emission into a thin space, largely
separating oxide and copper; and in terms of the diffusion of
electrons from copper into oxide, producing a hump of negative " "
charge whose shape will vary with the direction of the applied
potential between oxide and copper. Of these explanations, some
seem to have no valid arguments in their favour, while none is able
to explain completely the experimental facts.
The Photoelectric Cell.-Comparatively recently it was found that
these rectifier discs, if illuminated, generated a potential difference
between the electrodes.20 The earlier experiments were made with
arrangements where the light struck only the edge of the discs;
later, more efficient cells were made in which the light reached the
oxide layer through a semi-transparent coating, e.g., of sputtered
gold, which also served as the electrode, thus allowing use to be
made of the whole sensitive surface. (Similar cells are now being
made commercially in which selenium, rather than cuprous oxide,
is the sensitive element.) Considerable electrical outputs are obtain-
able from such cells; thus E. D. Wilson 21 obtains one watt per
sq. m. of active surface. The technique of the use and amplification
of these photocurrents is very different from that appropriate to the
usual vacuum or gas-filled photoelectric cell, owing to the much
lower internal resistance of the source.
The properties of these cells have been widely investigated, though
attempts to explain their action have not been completely successful
-as one might expect, in view of the probably intimate relation
between the rectifier and the photoelectric action. The emission of
electrons is supposed to take place at the boundary between oxide
and copper, where a blocking layer or Sperrschicht has been

the photoeffectm ust be located at the front wall (Vorderwand) of
“ I’
the cell, Le., the boundary between the oxide and the upper (trans-
parent) electrode ; and in these cases the direction of flow of current
through the cell is reversed. The assumption of a blocking-layer
possessing unilateral transparency to electrons, and the transference
of this layer from one side to the other of the oxide layer, according
to the observed direction of flow of the current, certainly seems to
be rather arbitrary. Dember thinks the blocking-layer (which is
essentially regarded as a characteristic of the oxidemetal junction)
to be an unnecessary assumption, in view of the photoelectric
potential difference which he obtains in pure cuprous oxide crystals,
as we have described; and the criticisms of E. Perucca and R.
Deaglio 23 support this view. Bulian,ls in a very interesting paper,
comes to the same conclusion; he shows that the same photocell
may exhibit a reversal of E.M.F. as its temperature is altered, or if
the thickness, i.e., the transparency, of the upper layer is changed.
The significance seems to lie in the optical properties of the oxide
layer ; light for which the oxide is transparent (say 1>04 p) exhibits
the back-wall effect, while light to which it is more opaque gives the
front-wall effect. The thickness of oxide, nature of the upper
electrode, and colour of the light will decide for any particular cell
which of these tendencies has the upper hand. Very similar are the
conclusions of H. H. Poale and W. R. G. AtkinsYzw4 ho explored the
sensitive surface of a photocell with a small patch of light of wave-
length about 0.61 v; they found that the direction of current flow
varied as the patch was moved from one point to another, and
ascribed this effect to the varying opacity of the film.
Therml Expansion of Crystal Lattices.-Before the advent of
X-rays, (‘c oefficient of expansion referred only to the behaviour
”
of the massive substance. The question has been reoently raised
whether this coefficient, measured by macroscopic methods, ought
necessarily to agree with the expansion deduced from the spacing
of the lattice, measured by X-rays. If there is a difference, what is
its significance? For a crystal to give a sharp X-ray reflexion, its
lattice must be perfect over many thousands of elementary periods ;
but it is unlikely that this perfection is strictly maintained over the
whole of any crystal of experimental size without occasional dis-
locations. Elsewhere in this Report reference is made to the mass

arguing on the basis of this assumed structure, F. Zwicky25 pre-
dicted that a difference between these two expansions should exist.
A difference has, in fact, been reported by A. Goetz and R. C.
Hergenrother 26 with single bismuth crystals. These workers claim
to have shown that along the trigonal axis the X-ray expansion
coefficient increased with temperature up to the melting point, but
the coefficient measured optically (i.e., by using interference fringes
to measure the small displacements) remained constant till near the
melting point, after which it decreased rapidly. They also found
that the X-ray coefficients do obey Gruneisen's law,27w hereas the
optically determined ones did not. (Gruneisen's law requires an
approximate proportionality between expansion coefficient and
specific heat.) The discontinuities in the properties of bismuth
which other workers have found at 75" and near the melting point
were not detectable on the X-ray expansion coefficient curve. As
an explanation it was suggested that an amorphous component
coexists with the lattice, which increases relatively to the lattice
with increasing temperature. On the other hand, A. H. Jay28
finds no difference between the coefficients measured optically and
by X-rays for silver and for quartz over a temperature range of
18" to 730".*
The X-ray expansions of several hydroxides, those of magnesium,
calcium, and aluminium, all layer structures, have been measured by
(Miss) H. D. Megaw,asw ho finds a general anisotropy, the expansions
perpendicular to the layer over a range 0-100" being greater than
those parallel to the layer. In general, the measurement of lattice
expansions in various directions should lead to results of significance.
Thus J. B. Austin and R. H. H. Pcarce 30 showed for crystals of
sodium nitrate that the gradual transition occurring between 150"
and 278" is marked along the c-axis, but not detectable dong the
a-axis. This transition they interpret as a separation of nitrate

no difference between the two coefficients of expansion for bismuth, and
ascribes the contrary result to experimental error.

layers corresponding to a change of thk vibrational energy of the
nitrate ion to the rotational state. R. Becker and E. Orowan 31
find that the expansion of a single zinc crystal is not smooth, but
exhibits several jumps, whose steepness increases rapidly with rise
of temperature. A. Miiller 32 investigated the expansion coefficients
of a series of long-chain compounds from liquid-air to melting-point
temperatures, and found marked differences between the coefficients
measured along the three crystal axes.
Melting-point Phenorn,em.-The measurement of thermal expan-
sions leads naturally to the drastic changes in the lattice which occur
at the melting point, There is considerable evidence, of interest on
the one hand to the study of liquid structure in general and on the
other to the problems of nuclear formation and crystal growth, that
immediately above the melting point a great deal of molecular
orientation persists. This is shown by the experiments of A.
Goetz33 on the growth of single bismuth crystals, also by W. L.
Webster,34 who investigated the persistence of nuclei above the
melting point for several metals, including bismuth. The nuclei
showed time-temperature hysteresis effects and exhibited great
differences in stability. It has also been found that crystals of
erythritol, held for several minutes 1" or 2" above the melting point,
will recrystallise into single crystals with approximately the same
orientation as that of the original cry~tal.~ST he stability of
crystalline nuclei in superheated melts has been considered from
the kinetic standpoint by R. Bloch, T. Brings, and W. K~hn,a3n~d
it is shown that they may be expected to melt more slowly, though
thermodynamically they are at least as unstable as large crystals at
the same temperature.
Recent evidence as to the precise temperature range over which
melting-point or transition phenomena occur is rather scanty,
W. L. Webster3' showed that for bismuth the temperatures of
emission of latent heat, of acquisition of rigidity, and of anomalous
diamagnetic susceptibility all coincided within the experimental
error of 0-3". A. Miiller 32 found remarkable changes in the lattices
of the long-chain hydrocarbons within a few tent,hs of a degree."

We may mention the work of P. A. Thiessen and E. Ehrlich,4O
who observed the structure of the crystalline sodium salts of the
long-chain fatty acids. The melting points of these acids are below
those of their salts; and in each case as the salt was taken through
the temperature at which the corresponding acid melted, it was
found that the cooling curve showed a discontinuity and the expan-

Lattice Theory.-A very interesting paper by H. S. Taylor,
H. Eyring, and A. Sherman41a ttempts to trace the growth of a crystal
lattice from the vapour phase, ie., single atoms, applying the
perturbation methods of quantum mechanics to the calculation of
the energies of various possible configurations. The calculations
are applied chiefly to sodium, and the binding energies, as afunction
of distance apart in various configurations, are evaluated for from
two to eight sodium atoms. Prom the curves, the most probable
process of growth of the lattice may be followed; a square having
once been formed, the fifth atom will be added at another corner of
the cube, the sixth will go to the body-centre position (where it has
a considerable stabilising influence), and remaining atoms will
complete the cube corners. Although these are the most probable
configurations, definite amounts of energy are required for their
consummation ; the process of building up the lattice is difficult
rather than easy, and we may expect finely divided particles and
surfaces at which crystallisation is taking place to be abnormally
active-as, of course, we know to be the case. The elementary
cube which this calculation indicates has a unit edge of 3.4 A. as
against 4.3 A. for massive sodium.
M. Born, J. E. Mayer, and L. Helmholtz 42, 43 have improved the
general lattice theory by three variations of the energy content.
The repulsion potential is expressed as an exponential term where
before it was given as a power term. Van der Waals's cohesion
force is also introduced into the calculation. This theory has been
applied to the empirical data for the alkali halides. A very simple
relation between lattice energies and ionic radii and valency has
been discovered by A. F. KapustinskiM and applied by him and

B. Veselovski45 to about 100 substances. If the lattice energy be
+
plotted against l/(rK rA)w here rK, T, are the radii of kation and
anion respectively, then for these substances the points lie close to
a straight line, so that the maximum divergence of the lattice energy
from that corresponding to the straight line is about 10%. The
validity of this formula makes approximate calculations very simple.
Compressibility of Crystals.-The most direct way of investigating
the bonds between the atoms of a crystal lattice is, of course, to alter
the distance between them by externally applied forces; but to
make any perceptible effect, these forces must be very great. The
masterly technique of P. W. Bridgman 46 has rendered possible
accurate measurements at pressures as high as 12,000 kg./sq. cm.;
a full description of the methods and precautions necessary for such
work is given in his book.
If we attempt to form the equation €or the potential energy in
terms of position of an atom in a lattice-considering, e.g., an ionic
lattice of the alkali halide type-then the attractive term is usually
ascribed to the electrostatic (Coulomb) forces of the oppositely
charged ions, so that its form is known. E. Madelung4' has
calculated the potential energy due to this attractive force for
various types of lattice. We are, however, in ignorance of the form
of the repulsive term necessary to give stability to the lattice; all
that we can say is that it vanishes at great distances and is very
large at small ones. The measured lattice spacing, of course,
represents the position of equilibrium between these two forces,
It is usual to express this repulsive term as a convergent infinite
series and to determine the coefficients of the separate terms directly
by comparison with the measured compressibilities (for if the
potential function is known the theoretical compressibility can be
written down immediately). This has been done, e.g., by J. C.
Slater,48 whose work also confirms our assumption above that the
attractive forces are purely electrostatic in nature. But the scope
of the measurements, even over the largest possible range, is not
sufficient to determine more than the first two coefficients in the
expansion, so that extrapolation of the potential function beyond
the experimental range becomes very hazardous. Several attempts 43
have been made to suggest forms of function which on theoretical
grounds would permit of this extrapolation with more confidence.

properties of crystals and a discussion of the work on ice was sum-
marised by P. Debye.49 More recently J. Errera 6og 61s 62 and his
school have investigated a number of substances, in many cases with
special reference to the relation of the dielectric constant to the
crystallographic direction. The work falls into two parts according
as the crystals do or do not contain orientable permanent dipoles.
The alkali and alkaline-earth halides illustrate the rule that the
portion of the dielectric constant which may be attributed to relative
displacement of the ions of opposite electric signs decreases with
increasing size of anion for a given kation and also decreases with
increasing size of kation for a given anion. The nitrates of lead,
calcium, strontium, and barium follow the same rule, the case of lead,
which has the same ionic radius as barium, showing the increase of
ionic polarisation with increase of atomic number. The fluorides
of iron, cobalt, and nickel have ionic polarisations which increase in
this order, corresponding to the decrease in ionic size. The remark-
able case of rutile and anatase, for which the dielectric constants are
114.0 and 48.0 respectively, has not received adequate explanation.
The orthorhombic sulphates of strontium, barium, and lead show
an unexpectedly high value of the dielectric constant along the
b-axis. As for the nitrates, the ionic polarisation for the lead salt is
much greater than for the barium and the strontium salt. The
rhombohedra1 carbonates show the greatest ionic polarisation along
the trigonal axis, whilst for the rhombic carbonates the differences
along the crystallographic axes are much less marked. The platino-
cyanides of calcium, strontium, and barium show in each case the
greatest dielectric constant perpendicular to the principal cleavage.
Although they contain water of crystallisation, they do not shorn
the dispersion with frequency characteristic of ice. The magnesium
salt, containing seven instead of five molecules of water of crystallis-
ation, does show this anomalous dispersion for the direction per-
pendicular to the good cleavage (001). Thus two molecules of water
of crystallisation are differentiated from the others and are orientable
when the field is applied in a particular direction.
The investigation of the crystals containing permanent dipoles
which may be oriented in the electric field has given results which
suggest important applications in problems of crystal structure. As
mentioned above, salts containing water of crystallisation sometimes
show a dispersion of the dielectric constant both with frequency 4nd
with temperature similar to that observed in ice. It occurs in

loosely bound water of crystallisation. Thus in gypsum and in
most alums 52 there is no such anomalous dispersion. Rochelle salt
has been extensively studied in connexion with its piezo-electric
and dielectric characters. Errera has extended the frequency range
of the investigation and found the same great increase in the di-
electric constant at a particular frequency and over a restricted
-+
temperature interval of - 10" to 25". The maximum dielectric
constant recorded is 1300 for a field strength of 200 volts/cm. The
electrical properties of mixed crystals from sodium potassium
tartrate have also been studied. The application of X-ray
533 j4
diffraction to the study of the displacement of the ions in Rochelle
salt 55 in an electric field marks an important advance. Another
phenomenon50 which may be inportant in the study of liquid
crystals is the anomalous rapid rise in the dielectric constant of
acetic acid and of p-azoxyanisole just at the moment of crystallis-
ation. It occurs only for low frequencies. The tentative explana-
tion put forward by the discoverer is that just on solidifying the
liquid condenses into a large number of polar groups which in a
field of low frequency can orientate themselves.
Electrical Byeakdown in Crystals.-During the past three years a
systematic study of the phenomena accompanying electrical break-
down in crystals has been made. To cause the discharge to pass
through the crystal it is necessary to overcome the tendency of the
discharge to pass round the edges of the specimen. This has been
done by (Miss) L. Inge and A. Walther,56 who used a point electrode
resting on the crystal which in turn rested on a large plate. Under
normal conditions of discharge, of duration greater than 10-7 sec.,
the crystal is destroyed, but by using special electrical circuits these
authors were able to apply the potential for so short a time that the
discharge did not strike right through the crystal. A. von Hippel 57
also succeeded in avoiding spurious effects by placing the crystal
between two slightly rounded electrodes, filling the space between
crystal and electrodes with specially prepared bees-wax, and mount -
ing this apparatus in nitrogen at a pressure of about 100 atmospheres.
The results obtained by the two methods are not always the same.
For instance, for rock salt, Inge and Walther find that the discharge
passes from the pointed electrode along [lll] directions in the
crystal, whereas Hippel finds that first [110) and then [ill] are the

favoured directions. In the latter experiments the discharge
always branches from the anode, whereas in Inge and Walther’s
work the branches grow from the point in each case, but much better
when it is positive than when it is negative. The difference between
these results is presumably due to the fact that in Hippel’s apparatus
the discharge begins in a fairly uniform field and only after the track
has penetrated a certain distance into the crystal does the gradient
at its end become very steep. In Inge and Walther’s method the
gradient at the beginning of the discharge, being that around the
point, is very steep. For barytes, the favoured directions for the
discharge are approximately [loo], [loll and [Oll] ; in calcite, two
of the [1 111 directions (which correspond to [1 11 1 in sodium chloride) ;
[loo] in fluorite and 111111 occur according as the plates are cut
parallel to (11 1) or (100); in beryl the discharge tracks run parallel
to the hexad axis-a direction in which there are holes in the
“ ”
structure. Hippel has investigated the variation of the strength of
the breakdown field in the alkali halide series and finds, after making
allowance for small differences for different crystallographic direc-
tions, values which range from >2.0 x lo6 volts per cm. for lithium
fluoride to 0.50 x lo6 volts per cm. for rubidium iodide. Parallel
with this decrease in the breakdown field goes a change in the
appearance of the tracks. For lithium fluoride they are sharp but
become more diffuse as the ionic radii increase. Experiments on
magnesium oxide indicate that the exchange of a doubly for a singly
charged ion in the same structural type leads to a great increase
in dielectric strength. Considerable difference of opinion existed
between the investigators as to the mode of origin of the tracks,
whether by acceleration of positive ions or of electrons. The total
evidence appears to favour Hippel’s view that the phenomenon is
primarily due to electrons, accelerated towards the anode, acquiring
sufficient energy to ionise by collision. The track of the electrons
becomes conducting, and as it advances towards the cathode the
potential gradient at its advancing end increases. Plastic deform-
ation increases the dielectric strength, which would not be expected
if ions were the conductors, since the cracks introduced by the
deformation would provide easier paths for the ions than exist in the
undeformed crystal. Other difficulties in accounting for the facts
by an ionic discharge are that the time of the discharge is shorter
than would be expected in this case, and that the breakdown
potential is independent of the previous ion current. Hippel
supposes that a slow-moving electron makes collisions with the
atoms and loses energy to them in thermal agitation. As the
velocity of the electron is increased, it will lose more energy per
impact, corresponding to the greeter number of acoustic, thermal,
and infra-red characteristic frequencies to which it may lose energy.

If it has energy greater than the characteristic frequency of the
lattice, i.e.,t he reststrahlen frequency, it will begin to accumulate
“ ”
energy and bring about the discharge. This is borne out by the
constancy (within 12%) for all the alkali halides of the ratio of the
energy acquired by an electron in falling in the breakdown field
through a length equal to the side of the unit cell to the quantum
associated with the reststrahlen frequency. The correlation
“ ”
of the direction of the breakdown paths with the crystal structure
is not yet clear, but it has been suggested with a certain amount of
experimental justification that the discharge occurs in directions in
which there are rows of neighbouring ions having the same sign of
charge.
The Elastic and Plustic Properties of Crystals.-Elasticity. Several
new methods of determining elastic moduli have been intro-
d~ced.6~I6n~ o ne of thesess H-shaped rnasscs were attached to
the ends of the rod under test, which was supported by a long
thin bifilar suspension. The outer limbs of the upper H were
bar-magnets each of which was surrounded by coils of many turns
in which currents were induced by the vibration of the magnets.
These induced currents were amplified and the frequency was
compared with a known frequency impressed on the same circuit.
The bar was set into oscillation by a blow with a small hammer
imparted to the end of one of the magnets. This mode of producing
oscillation gave rise to both torsional and flexural vibrations, but
these could be distinguished by observation of the sum and difference
of the currents induced in the two coils. The elastic moduli were
calculated from the vibration frequency and the dimensions of the
rod. Another apparatus 59 for determining elastic moduli con-
sisted of two identical gravity pendulums suspended from the top
of the test plate which was clamped at the bottom. When one
pendulum was started, the slight movement of its support caused
the other pendulum to begin swinging. This process continued until
the first had stopped swinging, its energy having been transferred
to the second. The time between two successive stoppages of the
same pendulum, together with the relevant dimensions of tho
apparatus, were sufficient data for calculating Young’s modulus for
the crystal plate. By using torsional instead of gravity pendulums,
the rigidity modulus was found. The method devised originally
by Quirnby has been adapted to measurements of elastic moduli

by Za~harias.A~ ~c omposite bar consisting of quartz cemented to
the end of the bar under test was suspended by threads so as to
vibrate freely. The quartz had been cut so that it could be set into
longitudinal vibration on applying an alternating potential to its
side faces. To find the unknown modulus for the crystal, it was
necessary to know the frequency for which resonance occurred
between the vibrations of the composite rod and the electrical
circuit, the dimensions of the quartz and crystal, and the elastic
constants of the quartz. Recent determinations of elastic constants
include those of 65 quartz,66, 6 7 gold-silver,68 alumin-
ium,69 nickel,63 and Rochelle salt.61 The dynamical
methods of determining the elastic moduli depend on the theory of
torsional and flexural vibrations of a monocrystalline rod. This
has been worked out by E. Goens,'l using the fundamental work of
Voigt. Although primarily concerned with piezo-electric characters,
the book by P. Vigoureux 72 gives an excellent pfesentation of the
theory and data of the elastic properties of quartz.
Plasticity. Much has been written on the plastic deformation
of metals, but it would not be profitable to attempt a review of this
subject here. Among non-metallic substances, roclr-salt has been
most studied. Whilst there is good reason for investigating this
substance on account of its simple crystal structure and the developed
state of its lattice theory, yet generalisations are dangerous until the
corresponding data are available for more substances. The experi-
ments on the increase of the tensile strength of rock-salt on wetting,
described originally by JoffB, have called forth many investig-
ation~.'~-*~So me of the results oE these have verified the increase

of tensile strength caused by ~etting.~*-'A~ rotation of some
portions of the crystal relative to others through angles up to 30"
is observed in the wet salt but not in the dr~.~T6h e distortion of
the lattice makes it monoclinic near the surfaces along which gliding
occurs.73,7 6 The crystals show a considerable increase in strength
after previous plastic deformation, but this author finds that the
elastic limit of previously undeformed and uniformly dissolved
cleavage rods of rock-salt agrees within the error limit with that of
dry natural crystals.81 Measurement of the hardness of rock-salt
by the damping method with the Kusnetzov pendulum 83 shows no
difference in hardness between the dry and the previously wetted
rock-salt. Further, the elastic limit of the rock-salt in water,
determined in polarised light, is the same as that of the dry salt.
Investigations on dry rock-salt have been summarised by A.
Smeka1.84 He concludes that the purest crystal prepared under the
best conditions still has inhomogeneities which are responsible for
the difference between the characters, in particular the breaking
strength, of the actual and the theoretically ideal crystals. On
applying stress to the crystal, glide planes develop from these
inhomogeneities as soon as the stress exceeds the breaking or shear-
ing stress for the ideal crystal. The crystal is no longer single but
polycrystalline, and further deformation merely alters the number
and mutual orientation of the individual grains. At a temperature
somewhat below the melting point and for extensive deformation
the polycrystal reaches a breaking strength close to that of the
theoretical crystal, a fact which is explained as being due to the great
disarrangement of the grains which prevents any further gliding, so
that the real strength of the crystal is observed. The justification
for this theory is based on extensive experiments. The strength of
the pure crystal (99.995% pure) has been found at temperatures
from 1.2" K. up to the melting point.85-88 The strength is constant
+
up to - 190°, decreases to 40", and then increases until near the
melting point. The effect of known amounts of impurities has also
been The complications arising from the
893
plasticity have been almost overcome by working at low tempera-
tures. The influence of impurities may be seen from the following
example.s6 Rock-salt containing 0.045% of strontium chloride has,
at room temperature, a tensile strength of 1000 g./mm.2 as compared

with 213 g./mm.2 for the pure substance. The increase of strength
caused by the impurity decreases as the temperature is lowered,
until at - 110" it is zero. On still further lowering of temperature,
the impurity weakens the crystal until at - 190" and - 252" the
same amount of impurity reduces the strength from 560 g./mm.2 to
135 g./mm.2 A. Smekal8* concludes that the influence of impurities
could certainly explain the difference between the ideal breaking
stress (20,000--40,000 kg./cm.2) and that of the best realisable
crystal (60 kg./cm.2). If an artificially coloured rock-salt crystal be
deformed as far as possible, its absorption maximum moves towards
the red (465 to 475 P ) . ~ T he corresponding change in excitation
energy is 0.05 volt, and if this be interpreted as being the strain
energy of the lattice at the coloured inhomogeneity, the correspond-
ing stress is 16,000 kg./cm.2. This value is close to that of the
theoretical rock-salt crystal and the observation shows that the
stress at the points where gliding occurs reaches nearly to the ideal
breakdown stress. As the crystal is progressively deformed, irre-
versible double refraction91992 first appears at a stress of about
6 kg./cme2. At the same stress, the photoconductivity begins to
increase 93 and the ionic conductivity first begins to vary.S3 The
very beginning of the process of deformation is thereforc connected
with an increase in the number of inhomogeneities and with the
break-up of the single crystal. It is therefore improbable that ideal
gliding ever occurs, and that even in metals, e.g., zinc, where the
gliding appears so simple, there is from the beginning of the deform-
ation an irreversible increase in the number of faults in the lattice.
The plastic properties of rock-salt at temperatures up to 600" have
been investigated with special reference to annealing and increase
of strength with plastic deformation.88, 9 4-g8 Since very small
amounts of impurities greatly affect the mcchanical properties of
rock-salt, a method has been devised of observing them by means
of an ultramicroscope. The number of ultramicroscopic particles
can be correlated with the mechanical properties and ultra-violet
absorption.99,1 The energy imparted to the crystal as a result of

deformation may, in the case of metals, be of a kind which cannot
be detected by X-rays, i.e., is not accounted for by the change in
the lattice dimensions.2 In one case it was shown that about O-lyo
of the extension energy was retained by the strained lattice, whereas
15% of the energy was left in the crystal under some other form of
strain. Measurements of t'he force and work necessary to produce
cleavage in several crystals under various conditions have been
Two investigations on quartz 798 have thrown light on
its previously obscure plastic properties. The production of
mechanical twins and their demonstration by etching is both striking
and convincing. The breaking stress under compression is fifteen
times smaller at the transition temperature, 573", than at room
temperature. The plastic properties of fluorspar calcite,1° potass-
ium halides,g2m ica 11 and the nature of the glide planes in a catholic
selection of substances 12, l3 have also been studied.
Secondary Structure.-It has been generally assumed that an
ideal lattice of the rock-salt type is stable. The calculations of the
tensile strength based on this assumption lead, as was mentioned
above, to a value several hundred times greater than that observed
in the best crystals. This led F. Zwicky l4 to put forward the theory
of '' secondary structure which is, briefly, that superimposed on
the well-established lattice, known from X-ray diffraction, is another
lattice on a scale such that its unit cell would have a side about
1 p long. The planes of this lattice are supposed to contain more
ions per unit area than parallel planes in the rest of the crystal.
According to this picture, the crystal would, however pure and how-
ever carefully prepared, grow with & " block " structure. The
weakness of the natural crystals is, according to this view, a neces-
sary consequence of the nature of the secondary structure. This
hypothesis has been used to explain many of the periodic or pseudo-
periodic phenomena occurring in crystals and the existence of these
periodicities, on a scale of about 1 p, has been taken by Zwicky and

others as support for the theory. Smekal has concluded that no
such hypothesis is necessary to explain the weakness of the natural
rock-salt crystal, the natural inhomogeneities both mechanical and
chemical being the prime cause of the diminution of strength. If
the hypotheses of secondary structure is unnecessary it remains to
account for the large-scale periodicities. A short account of these
follows.
The diffraction effects observed in crystals of potassium chlorate
were thoroughly investigated by R. W. W00d,15 and he concurred
with Stokes in interpreting them by assuming periodic twinning.
As many as 1000 planes, almost equidistant from one another, must
occur in a single crystal in order to explain the narrowness of the
spectral band reflected at a particular angle by the crystal. The
natural (111) faces of perfect crystals of bismuth show fine striz
intersecting at 60". A. Goetz l6 has attempted to show that the
distances between the striz are all simple multiples of about 1 p by
superposing a triangular network of lines on the observed pattern
and adjusting the size of the triangles until each observed line coin-
cided with a line of the net. The side of the smallest triangle so
-+
found is given as 1.4 0.2 p. The correspondence between net and
stria? is not convincing, particularly as neighbouring lines are not
always parallel and their distance apart is only a few times their
width. Goetz has etched the (111) faces of bismuth crystals very
carefully, and found that triangular pits are developed. He asserts
that the sides of these triangles coincide with the lines of the net
already fitted to the crystal in the previous observation. The
published photographs do not give much support to this. Another
line of research has been pursued by M. Straumanis.l7,1 8 Crystals
of cadmium and zinc were prepared by sublimation under carefully
controlled conditions. The edges of the hexagonal plates so formed
were bounded by heavily striated faces. A vertical section through
the crystal showed a step-like formatioil at the edge, arid he found
that the heights of the steps were approximately whole multiples
of 0.8 & 0.1 p. Zinc crystals also formed by sublimation were
deformed so that gliding took place along the basal plane. The
crystal after deformation appears, when viewed from the side, like a
pack of cards pushed over to one side. The steps, however, are not
bounded by vertical faces but by curved sloping faces, showing that
gliding has occurred also on planes in between those usually denoted
as slip-planes. The latter are 0.8 & 0-1p apart, a distance equal to

the height of the steps obtained when the crystal is grown by
sublimation. It is difficult to judge froni the photographs within
what limits the separation of the glide planes is a whole multiple of
0.8 p, but it is clear that the separation is often several times this
distance. Thus, although the phenomenon of gliding may be
associated with a lattice the planes of which are 0.8 p apart, they are
not all equivalent-a fact which distinguishes this type of lattice
from that determined by X-ray analysis. On a scale about 100 times
greater than that involved in the above experiments, periodic
precipitation of cadmium between single crystals of zinc was
observed by Straumanis.19 Photographs show that the precipita-
tions occur at intervals which are constant to within about 10%
and vary according to the rate of crystallisation and the concentra- +
tion of cadmium from about to mm. Investigations have also
been made of the etching of various faces of zinc crystals by hydro-
chloric acid, and in many cases the etching has taken place along
nearly parallel and equidistant lines. It is important to observe
that the lines are sometimes not parallel, though the deviation
from parallelism is small. In a paper zo on the lattice-like
inclusions of magnesium silicate in calcite from North Burgess,
Ontario, are some photographs which show inclusions arranged
parallel and, over a limited region, equidistant. The separation is
of the order of 0.1 mm. When larger regions are considered it
would be necessary, if a fundamental repeat distance were sought,
to choose one not much larger than the width of the inclusions them-
selves. The inclusions were presumably deposited whilst the crystal
was solid along the intersections of twin planes. The regularity of
the spacing of the needles is thus an indication of the regular spacing
of the twin planes.
It has been suggested that the discrepancy between the wave-
lengths of X-rays determined from crystals and from artificially
ruled gratings is due to the secondary structure.21 The planes of
the secondary structure are supposed to be of greater density than
the rest, and this would therefore cause a small error in the deter-
mination of wave-length. However, there is disagreement between
various authors 22-24 as to whether there is any discrepancy between
the wave-lengths obtained by the two methods. Some physical
properties of bismuth crystals are different according as they are

grown in or out of a magnetic 26 No difference could be found
between the spacing of the (111) and (111) planes of crystals grown
in, and of those grown out of, a magnetic field, indicating that the
changes in physical properties were associated with the way in which
the blocks of perfect crystal were assembled rather than with the
properties of the blocks themselves.27 Mention has already been
made of the reported difference between the thermal expansion
determined optically and by X-rays for bismuth. This result is
interpreted as indicating that the portions of the crystal between the
planes of the secondary structure expand uniformly up to the
melting point, but that the planes of the secondary structure begin
to break down at a temperature 35" lower.
In attempting to form an opinion on the existence of the secondary
structure from these periodic phenomena, it is important to bear in
mind our ignorance of the exact nature and origin of the inhomo-
geneities which are so important in rock-salt. The other substances
cited were probably not so pure as the rock-salt used by Smekal, and
a rhythmic separation of the impurities might well give rise to the
observed phenomena. A special theory is not required to explain
the separation of cadmium from zinc on a macroscopic scale, and it
seems unnecessary to introduce one when the scale is reduced a
thousand-f old.

STRUCTURCARLY STALLOGRAPHY.
The methods of structure analysis have not been radically altered
in the past two years, but they have acquired additional certainty
and precision. The Weissenberg goniometer has come more and
more into use, and, together with other moving-film goniometers,2
has made the indexing of reflexions and determination of space
group a purely mechanical operation, so that mistakes on this
score have practically disappeared. At the same time the use of
integrating photometers 3 has made photographic intensity deter-
mination as accurate as ionisation spectrometer measurement,
thus immensely extending the range of crystals available for com-

plete analysis, especially for organic crystals, where the work of
the Davy Faraday Laboratory (see below, p. 414) has been so
outstanding. Fourier analysis, though still very laborious, has
been undertaken in many cases, and it has become the recognised
end of a structure determination to give, not only the atomic
positions, interatomic distances, and angles, but some idea of the
electronic density at different points in the cell. At the same
time, methods of handling small crystals,4 amorphous solids, fibres,
and liquids have so improved that it may now be fairly claimed
that there is no material, however minute in quantity or unpromis-
ing in appearance, that will not yield significant information on
examination with X-ray or electron methods.
Quite apart from structure analysis, X-ray methods can be used
for accurate quantitative analysis by measurement of intensities
of diffraction : this has been used by M. E. Nahmias to study the
changes occurring in the production of porcelain from clay.6 Of
more general application have been the methods based on the
precise measurements of spacing. Lattice dimensions can now be
measured to one part in 100,000, and without undue difficulty to
one in 10,000, particularly by a simple method, adaptable to any
powder camera, developed by A. J. Bradley and A. H. Jay.'
Dimensions thus obtained are highly characteristic for a pure sub-
stance. J. ,A. BeardenY8f or instance, found for three samples of
calcite from different localities spacings of 3-02805, 3.02807, and
3.02808 A. at 20". However, traces of substances in solid solution
affect the spacings in a regular manner, and the variation can be
used to determine the amount of the phase constituents. By
quenching at different temperatures, or still better by the use of a
high-temperature X-ray camera: phase boundaries can thus be
followed with an accuracy which, for the vertical lines of the
equilibrium diagram, surpasses that of any other method.l* Pre-
cision spacing measurements have also been used for measurement

CRYSTALC HEMISTRY.
Daltonian and Berthollide Compounds.
Possibly the most interesting development of crystal chemistry
is that centring round the regular and irregular structure of com-
pounds and solid solutions. From this field, evidence has been
gradually accumulating which goes far towards changing our ideas
on the laws of chemical composition. These laws, in particular
Dalton’s laws of constant and multiple proportions, were founded
on the study of simple molecular compounds, hydrogen, oxygen,
nitrogen, water, carbon dioxide, etc., and binary ionic compounds,
such as sodium chloride and calcium carbonate. Here these laws hold
in full rigidity, but there was something in Berthollet’s view that
they should not be extended to the whole of chemistry. In fact,
it is only in molecular chemistry-which includes organic chemistry-
that they are strictly true. In ionic chemistry they break down for
the simplest ternary systems, as mixed oxide and mixed halide
systems show, and for the chemistry of ores and metals even the
conception of valency breaks down completely, and attempts to
apply it only lead to unwieldy or incorrect formulze.
The validity of constant composition and valency rules depends,
we see now, either on dehite directed electron-sharing bonds, or
on the necessary equality of positive and negative ionic charges.
The first is true only of molecules or molecule ions (NO,)-,(CH,COO)-,
the second only leads to simple laws if all the ions of each sign are
of the same kind. Apart from these cases, regularity may arise
from the conditions of geometrical packing in crystals. Here it is
not so much a question of bonds or charges, but of the size and
shape of the units concerned, atoms, ions, molecule ions, or molecules.
If the sizes of the various components are very different and the
structure well fitted together, compounds result apparently of the
true Daltonian type. Such compounds are NaK, the alums, or the
molecular compounds of organic chemistry. They differ, however,
from true chemical compounds by having no existence apart from
the crystalline state.
If, however, the different units from which the crystal is built

only differ slightly in size and shape, they may come to occupy
indifferently the same positions. The simplest case of this kind
is that of normal solid solution, as of silver and gold or the mixed
crystal NaC1, KBr, and NaBr which may be written (NaK)(ClBr).
That size, and not charge or chemical character, is the pre-
ponderating factor, is shown by the work of E. Posnjak and
T. F. W. Barth13 in the case of lithium ferrite LiFeO,, which has
the rock-salt structure with Li+ radius 0-788 .o r Fe3+r adius 0.67 A.
occupying indifferently the cation positions. A more complicated
case is presented by the spinels discussed in the last report (1931,
28, 299). Barth’s theory of interchangeability of ions, which he
calls “ variate atomic equipoints,” has been established l4 for the
spinels MgFe,O,, MgGa,O,, MgIn204,T iMg,O,, TiFe,O,, and SnZn,O,,
but it does not hold for the aluminates of manganese, iron, cobalt,
nickel, and zinc, and probably not for the typical spinel MgAl,O,.
This conclusionh as been confirmed by F. Machatschki :l 5 the previous
differencesh ad arisen because the observers were working on different
compounds. The ion equivalence is not confined to cations. E.
Kordes l0 has prepared spinels of the type (Mg,Li)Al,(O,F),. The
presence of this extreme form of ion equivalence is, of course, con-
nected with the high crystallising temperature-in the region of
lOOO”-of these crystals, That this, however, is not a necessary
condition is shown by the appearance of the same phenomenon
in molecular crystals. S. B. Hendricksl7 has shown that the
crystals of p-chlorobromobenzene and an equimolar mixture of
p-dichloro- and dibromo-benzene are indistinguishable by X-ray
methods, the molecule of the former possessing a statistical centre
of symmetry showing that the intermolecular forces do not in this
case distinguish between chlorine and bromine. The clearest cases
of the conditions for interchangeable atoms are furnished by metals.
Nearly all metals mix in the liquid state, and in the solid not only
do similar metals, such as tungsten and molybdenum or antimony
and bismuth, form mixed crystals in all compositions, but the
face-centred metals y-Mn, y:Fe, P-Co, Ni, Cu, Rh, Pd, Ag, Ir, Pt,
Au, all form solid solutions in each other, and in most cases these
are unlimited. (Silver is somewhat exceptional, see p. 387.) In
such a mixed crystal the atomic positions are rigidly fixed-in this
case to the corners and face centres of a cube-but any kind of
atom can occupy any place. In all cases this is the state of affairs

just below the melting point, but in some a further regularity
appears on slow cooling. For instance, in a mixture of the com-
position of Cu,Au between 390" and the melting point at 960" all
the atoms occupy indifferently the points of a face-centred lattice,
but below 390" the gold atoms occupy the cube corners while the
copper occupy the cube face centres. Such structures are very
frequent among metals and have been called uberstrukturen,"
"
not very happily translated as '' superstructures." Alloys with
superstructures differ sharply from solid solutions in their mechanical,
magnetic, and electric properties,ls which resemble those of pure
metals : but this is merely an effect of regularity, and they should
not be considered as compounds unless we carefully distinguish
between chemical compounds and crystal compounds. Our know-
ledge of them has been greatly extended by the-detailed quantitative
study of the iron-aluminium system by A. J. Bradley and A. H.
Jay.19 Pure iron and FeAl both have atoms arranged in cubic
body-centred lattices : simply in iron, and with the centres occupied
by A1 atoms in FeAl (czesium chloride structure). The intermediate
alloys quenched from higher temperatures showed up to 25 atomic
yo of aluminium an irregular solid solution of a,luminium in iron,
between 25 and 50% aluminium an irregular solid solution of iron
in FeA1, i.e., with all the aluminium atoms not replaced by iron
still in the cube-centre positions. In annealed specimens a further
yo
regular superstructure appeared in the composition 25 aluminium.
This FeAl structure is also body centred but with a doubled cell of
16 atoms, and with iron atoms regularly disposed in half the centres
of the eight small cubes making up the unit cell. For compositions
between 18 and 40% aluminium this Structure persists, but X-ray
intensities show that replacement of iron or aluminium atoms
takes place in a complex but statistically orderly way, tending to
approximate to the simple Fe-A1 or FeAl-Fe solid solutions.
It is clear that in such cases we have to do with a phenomenon
analogous to the melting of a crystal, referring, not to change
between the regularity of atomic positions in a crystal and their
irregularity in a liquid, but to the regular and irregular arrange-
ments of atoms inside a given crystal structure. Such regular
arrangement must have a slightly lower potential energy, and
melts sharply with a correspondingly small latent heat of mixing
of the atomic species. The melting point is depressed by addition
of either constituent, as is that of a true compound. Undercooling,

however, is easy, because the transformation requires interchange
of atomic places; thus slow diffusion hinders the formation of
superstructures. At low temperatures the irregular solid solution
is in the same state, as far as position of specific atoms, as a glass;
it is not in equilibrium but cannot acquire it. The quantitative
thermodynamic study of such systems has been carried out by
W. L. Bragg,20 who has been able to show why the more compli-
cated forms of superstructure such as Fe-Al cannot exist. In this
connexion, it is worth recalling the recent studies in diffusion in
the crystalline state, particularly by G. von Hevesy and his
but also by a great number of other authors.22 There is no space
here for an adequate discussion, but it may be pointed out that
the diffusion rate D is given by Qa2INh. e-QIRT, where N is Losch-
midt’s number, 73 Planck’s constant, a is the shortest distance
between exchangeable atoms, and Q is the characteristic heat of
atom interchange of the substance; Q varies from SO kg.-cal. per
molecule for tungsten-molybdenum to 2.2 kg.-cal. for silver in silver
iodide, and is itself a function of the characteristic temperature,
or more simply, of the melting point of the substance = 3b2RTs,
where b does not vary much from 2.
In ionic compounds the anion diffusion is not much affected by
the nature of the cation, but the converse does not hold. The
velocity of diffusion of silver is least in the fluoride, increases to it
maximum for the iodide and sulphide, and then falls to low values
for the metallic AgSb, AgSn, AgAu. The effect of crystal distortion
or h e g rain size raises the diffusion constant in some cases by as
much as 40 times, but does not alter the interchange energy.
The types of non-Daltonian compound that have been discussed
can all be brought into line by abandoning an absolute effective
distinction between atoms or ions of different elementary species,
and treating them as substitutional mixed crystals. They can be
formulated in a Daltonian manner by such expressions as
(NaJX1-5)(ClyBrl--y) or (Fel-,Al,),(Al,,Fe,), where x-and y are no
longer whole numbers, and where no particular value of x and y
gives a compound sharply different from neighbouring values.
There are, however, two other forms of crystalline phase which
strain the definitions and laws still further, The first of these is

the interstitial compounds discussed in previous reports. The
metals of the transition groups can, without changing their struc-
ture, admit small atoms such as hydrogen, boron, carbon, or nitrogen
into the interstices between them, and these can exist either statis-
tically distributed or in definite positions. These may be called
additional solid solutions or additional crystal compounds respect-
ively, and may be formulated [FeIN, or [PclIH,,. Another non-
Daltonian type is that called by Hiigg subtraction solid solution or
compound, and has been studied particularly in the systems Fe-S 23
and Fe-Se,24 and also in Pe-0 studied by E. R. Jette and F. Foote.25
The structures found are for FeO the simple sodium chloride struc-
ture, for FeS the NiAs structure, for FeSe the lead oxide structure
at high and NiAs at low temperatures. In each case, however, a
range of solid solution on the iron-poor side exists, and in fact the
stoicheiometric compound FeO or E’eS cannot be formed at all, in
spite of the assurance of elementary chemical text books! The
lattice shrinks as the iron content is reduced, which is consistent
with the theory that it consists of an ideal lattice FeO, FeS, or FeSe,
with an increasing number of iron atoms removed, leaving spaces
which are partially filled by adjustments of the other atoms. Such
subtraction solid solutions may be formulated (Fe”Fe”’)l --zO, etc.
They may be expected in metallic compounds, where, owing to
great difference of atomic type, substitution cannot take place, and
in ionic compounds where the cation valency can vary. Subtrac-
tion compounds may exist as well as subtraction solid solutions :
the y structure of Cu,Zn,, CugA14,e tc., can be derived by dropping
two positions from a three-fold body-centred structure of 54 atoms.
Another example is the C-sesquioxide type of Mn,O,. This is a
subtraction compound derived from a two-fold fluorite structure,
in which one out of every four anions is dropped out, with conse-
quent slight displacements of all the ions.
The necessity of considering these non-Daltonian or Berthollide
compounds (a term first introduced by Kurnakow) 26 in relation
to the ordinary conceptions and notations of chemistry is becoming
increasingly urgent, as most metallic and sub-metallic (sulphide)
systems are essentially of this type, as well as many ionic and
molecular compounds. A. 0hma11,~’ who has discussed this ques-
tion from a structural and thermodynamic point of view, proposes

to distinguish them by the use of non-integral suffixes instead of
the integral ones of Daltonian compounds : for instance, for &-brass
he would write cZn~:~Ceux~pr:e~ss~in g merely the ranges of com-
position. A more informative symbolism would refer to the number
of interchangeable places in a crystal cell, extra places being indicated

by empty places by -, but it is time the whole matter was
taken up by an authoritative committee.
Transformation and Segregation in the Solid State.
Closely related to the question of mixed crystals and solid solu-
tion is that of the actual mechanism of separation of a homo-
geneous crystal phase into two or more others. Recent work,
particularly that of G. Sachs,28 R. F. Meh1,29D . W. SmithFO M. L.
FullerFl and H. HanemannF2 has shown that when an ore metal
phase separates on annealing into two, the separation takes place
along certain Lines or planes of the original crystal, giving rise to
the Widmanstatten structure first observed in meteoric iron. In
general, it is possible to show crystallographic reasons for the
mutual arrabgement on the interface between the new phases, the
general principle being to minimise the amount of atomic inter-
change necessary. This phenomenon is by no means confined to
metals : it lies at the back of most of the pseudomorphism, parallel
growths, mimetic and polysynthetic twinning that occurs in natural
minerals. The process has been experimentally studied in many
oxide and hydroxide systems. W. Bussem and F. Koberich33
have shown that when hexagonal brucite, Mg(O H),, dehydrates to
cubic periclase, MgO, the latter is oriented with its trigonal axis
parallel to the original hexagonal axis. As, however, the corre-
sponding planes are not quite identical, the periclase grows in a
strained double refracting form which does not become isotropic
till heated to 1150". Similar observations have been made by
M. Deflandrew and H. Schwiersch36 on the transformation of
diaspore AlO(0H) into corundum AI,O,. These reactions are
essentially similar to the polymerisation of organic molecules in the
solid to be discussed later (p. 425).

Crystal Topology.
The reduction of the multiple observed crystal types to some
common order based on topological relations between atoms and
groups is becoming an urgent question, because crystal chemistry
is largely unintelligible owing to its not being systematised. P.
Niggli and his school 36 continue their work in this field, but their
treatment is too formal as yet to have acquired many followers.
However, the work of F. Laves 37 on the classification of the silicates
indicates that the method has possibilities,
CRYSTAL STRUCTURE.
The number of papers on crystal structure in the last two years
is still greater than ever before, and. it has become quite impossible
in the scale of these reports even to mention all the new structures
described. The principle of selection has been to introduce only
such investigations as break new ground, or those of wider chemical
interest. The main lines of classification remain unchanged-
Metallic, Sub- metallic, Ionic, and Molecular.
Metallic.
There has been great activity in the field of fundamental theory
of metals, particularly of their electrical and magnetic properties,
but most of this falls outside the scope of a chemical report. The
work of U. DehlingerF8 however, is of peculiar systematic interest.
He points out that the properties of metals depend on the one
hand on the number of free electrons, and on the other, on the
interaction between the remaining ionic cores. This interaction,
which is practically nil for the alkali metals, reaches a maximum
in the transition and coinage metals, where it is the determining
factor for metallic properties. In particular, he links the colours
of copper, silver, and gold to the instability (multivalence) of
copper and gold, compared to the peculiarly stable alkali-like ion
of silver. In metals of this type, miscibility in liquid and solid
depends far more on the specific nature of the core than on atomic
radius. Silver, for instance, though it has almost exactly the same
atomic radius as gold, is far less miscible in the liquid or solid

state with iron, cobalt, copper, etc. Electrons in metals can fulfil
three functions. They can be free, belonging to the lattice as a
whole ; if the number of such electrons differs from the number
of atoms a p-, y-, or &-structurer esults; or the electrons can belong
predominantly to atom pairs, as in gallium, tin, bismuth, and B-group
metals in general; or they may be bound to the cores, as in mer-
cury, thallium, and lead, which function in the metallic state
mainly as Hg, Tl', and Pb" (cf. this vol., p. 120). In general,
atoms in compounds will not have the same charge as in the element.
Fe" in iron becomes Fe in iron-zinc alloys, as shown by the alloy
type and magnetic measurements. There can be resonance between
different possible states, as in the body-centred compound
[Cu++Pd+,-]=[Cu+Pd , which thus has the required elec-
tt3-]
tron : atom ratio 3 : 2. We are clearly at the beginning of a
theoretical metal chemistry of great complexity and interest. Its
difficulty can be judged by the fact that the Hume-Rothery rules,
which are more and more recognised as the empirical basis of metal
chemistry, have not as yet been satisfactorily explained, though
many attempts have been made, notably by U. Dehlinger,3* H.
Yerlitz,39 and Laves.40 W. Hume-Rothery himself ha's shown,
by a study of the alloys of copper with B-group metals, that the
position of the liquidus and solidus curve is determined by the
electron and not by the atom content of the solid solution.
As already mentioned, high precision methods have been much
applied recently, particularly to pure metals. Separate references
will not be given, as the measurements up to the middle of 1933
have been collected by M. Ne~burger.~O~ur knowledge of at least
one form of structure of the metallic elements is now nearly com-
plete; we lack knowledge only of scandium, masurium, ten of the
rare-earth metals , radium, actinium , and protoactiniuin.
Transition Metals and Their Interstitial Compounds.-Further
work on structures of transition metals at different temperatures
has shown that the allotropy of the type of iron is the rule rather
than the exception. Besides the regular, face-centred cubic, body-
centred cubic, and hexagonal close-packed, which seem to be the
iiormel forms at high temperatures, several much more complicated
structures have been found, often formed by electrolytic deposition.
These stable low-temperature forms are clearly difficult to get from
the melt, owing to slow diffusion, and many transition metals are
probably only known in their simple metastable forms. The

particular structures, thoqh complicated, arc of specid 8ta,bility,
iis shown by their appearance in more than one metal, as the 58
atom per cell structure common to y-Cr 43 and u-Mn, the 20 atom
per cell structure of 8-Mn iound also in Cu,Si, and the 8 atom per
cell u-W structure found also in Cr3Si.45 The last structure is
one of some interest. A cubic cell of side 5.03 A. for tungsten
and 4.55 8.f or Cr3Si contains two atoms at the corners and body
centre, and six others in pairs on each face with co-ordinates
of the type Oy+y$, O,+,i. This gives a pseudo-icosahedral 12-fold
co-ordination of the second type of atom (chromium) round the
first (silicon), which is actually closer than that of normal cub-
octahedral close packing.
The mechanism of allotropy has been studied in detail by U.
Dehlinger 46 in the case of cobalt. The transformation from cubic
hexagonal close packing takes place reversibly in single crystalg .
A similar transformation from cubic to tetragonal has been observed
by L. Graf 47 to occur for the crystal compound AuCu. Much work
has been done on the solid solution and superstructures among the
transition metals : references only can be given.48
Great advances have been made in the study of interstitial
compounds. K. Becker49 has given an interesting summary of
our knowledge of their physical properties. Most of them arc,

exceeding diamond. More work50 has been done on the char-
acteristic transformations of steel, which are typical examples of
Widmanstatten structure (see above, p. 386). A. Westgren and
his school have examined the more complex carbide, boride, and
silicide systems. In the carbides, including high-speed steel carb-
ides, the phases studied in order of increasing carbon content were
the following :-
(1) Cubic Fe3W3C,51 96 metal atoms per cell. This is really
a double interstitial structure, being based on a tungsten
carbide framework held together by iron atoms. Psomorphons
with this were Fe,W2C, Co3W3C, Ni3W3C, and Fe3M03C.
(2) Cubic CrZ3C6,Ii922 metal atoms per cell. This complex
structure is built from cubes and cuboctahedra of metal atoms
at an average distance of 2.5 8. apart. Isomorphous with it
are Ml123c6,F e,lW2C6: Fe,,Mo2C,, and Cr21W.&&.
(3) Orthorhombic Ye&. This is the familiar cementite
structure. Westgren 53 has shown that the structures previously
put forward for this (Ann. Reports, 1931, 28,294) are incorrect,
in that the carbon atoms should be placed as in tungsten
carbide and other carbides inside a trigonal prism, height and
side 2.66 A. Isomorphous with it are Mn3C and (MnFe),C
.
(spiegeleisen)
(4) Hexagonal Ni3C.5* This somewhat unstable compound
seems to be of Hagg's 12b, 6 type (see ibid., p. 293).
(5) Trigonal Cr,C3 and Mn,C,. This has not been further
studied and may have a more complicated formula.
(6) Hexagonal V2C and Mo,C, etc., of Hiigg's 12b, 6 type.
(7) Rhombic Cr3C2.s5 This is the most interesting of the
new structures. The cell is 11-5 x 5.5 x 2.8 8., space group
Dit - Pbnrn. All atoms lie in symmetry planes. The carbon
atoms are placed at the centres of a distorted trigonal prism
of chromium atoms, and form long zig-zag chains parallel to
the diad screw axis c, the G-C distance being 1.64 A. Here
we have no longer a true interstitial compound, but one
between chromium and dehydrogenated paraffin chains.

(8) Hexagonal WC, MoC, of Hiigg's Sb, 6 type. Here again
each carbon atom is at the centre of a trigonal prism of tungsten
atoms.
The structures of the borides of iron, cobalt, and nickel have been
studied by T. Bjurstrom : 56 the most interesting is that of FeB,
in which, as in Cr3C2,t he non-metal atoms form a zig-zag chain with
a B-B distance of 1-78 A. The average radius of the boron atom
in these compounds is 0.93 A. The silicides of chromium, man-
ganese, cobalt, and nickel have been studied by B. B~ren.~T' he
most interesting is that of Cr3Si, already mentioned. It is now
well established that the hydrogen dissolved in palladium exists
in the form of protons, as the heat of solution exceeds by about
20 kg.-cals. the heat of dissociation of molecular hydrogen. The
nature of the solutions and their conductivities have been studied
by F. Ifiiiger and G. Gehm,58 A. Coehn and K. S~erlinga,~nd~
G. RosenhalLG0 The conductivity is partially ionic, but the protons
only carry a small fraction of an electronic charge, and must conse-
quently be surrounded in the metal by an electronic cloud nearly
neutralising them. This property of dissociating hydrogen mole-
cules is shown to a less degree by nickel, and even less by other
metals of the eighth group and copper. It is clearly a necessary
condition for hydrogenating catalysis, but the catalytic efficiency
falls off as the heat of combination with hydrogen increases ; hence
nickel is a better hydrogenator than palladium.
Electron Compounds.-The compounds between transitional and
B (A) group metals obey Hume-Rothery's rules, and may appro-
priately be called electron compounds, as their crystal structure
depends in the main merely on the ratio of electrons to the atoms
they contain (see above, p. 388). Nearly fifty papers have in the
past two years been devoted to X-ray work on these compounds :
it is only possible to mention a small selection.
The range of alloy system investigated has been much increased
from the system TiAl 61 to AgLi. In the latter system H. Perlitz G2
has shown that a true y-phase exists between 76.3 and 80.2 atoms
yo of lithium. This corresponds to the formula Ag3Li,, and is a
most important exception to Hume-Rothery' s rules, as no combin-
ation of univalent silver and lithium can yield the electron ratio

ture yet known, it is perhaps unfair to expect the same rules to hold.
In the system manganese-zinc, studied by N. Parravano and
V. Caglioti,a a y-structure is also found, corresponding to the

P. Jones 64 are very complicated ; so is the FeSn system studied
by W. I?. Ehret and A. We~tgren.~Pe~S n at high temperatures
appears to have the NiAs structure. 0. Carlsson and G. Hagg66
have confirmed the extremely complex superstructures found by
the author 6' in the CuSn system-the cell of the ?-phase contains
500 atoms. S. Stenbeck fiinds,68 in a study of the AgHg and AuHg
systems, that the y-structure appears for a formula Ag,Hg,, exactly
obeying Hume-Rothery's rules. A. Olander 69 has analysed the
very interesting structure of AuCd with a tetragonal deformed
czesium chloride structure which changes above 267" to a true
c zsium chloride structure.
A- and B-Group Metals and Their Compounds.-Until recently
our knowledge of these was practically confined to the structures
of some of the elements. In the last two years this field has,
however, attracted much attention, and we are at last in a position
to form a fairly general picture of its metal chemistry.
This differs characteristically from that of transition metals and
electron compounds. Core interaction is much weaker, leading
to large interatomic distances, so that atomic size is an important
determinant of crystal type. On the other hand, where B-group
elements, particularly of the fifth and sixth group, are concerned,
homopolar- bonds are common, while compounds between A- and
B-group elements sometimes appear to be quasi-ionic : e.g., Na,+Pb4-
or Mg; '-Se4-.
Of the elements themselves, the most interesting new work
is on the allotropy of beryllium,70 ~alciurn,7a~n d probably of

BERNAL AND CROWE'OOT. 393
barium.7z Yttrium 73 proves to have a hexagonal structure exactly
intermediate between strontium and zirconium ; consequently it is
not clear whether it should be classed as an A-group or a transitional
metal. Enough rare-earth metals have been analysed to make the
systematic position of the group clear. The structures are all
hexagonal, but sometimes also cubic close packed : La (37.0),
Ce (34.1), Pr (36-3),'* Nd (36.1),'j and Er (36.9) have all the large
atomic volume characteristic of the A-group Na (39), or the heavy
B-group metals Pb (30), and much larger than those of the transi-
tion metals ranging from Zr (23) to Ni (10.9). (The figures in
parentheses give atomic volume in Most interesting from the
structural point of view is gallium, which has been very carefully
redetermined by F. Laves.76 The structure is not, as believed by
earlier workers, tetragonal, but orthorhombic. Each atom is sur-
rounded by seven others : one at 2.45, and two each at 2-70, 2.75,
and 2.79 A. Thus there exist in the solid actual Ga, molecules,
the first examples discovered in metallic crystals. These molecules
persist in the liquid, as has been shown by X-ray diffraction," the
pattern of which differs completely from that of monatomic liquid
mercury. The molecular nature is particularly interesting, as it
explains the low melting point, 37". Hume-Rothery's rule (Ann.
Reports, 1931, 28, 294) by which every B-group metal atom
should have 8 - N neighbours, where N is its group number,
seems definitely broken. But only apparently so, for an ideal
tetragonal structure can be made up in which each atom has five
neighbours, and this by a slight compression distorts into the actual
structure with seven neighbours, just as in the case of grey tin of
co-ordination number 4 passing into white tin with 6. The close-
packed structures of indium and lead show that for larger atoms
the generalised metallic attraction is predominant. The transform-
ations of arsenic and antimony from the amorphous into the glassy
state have been followed by X-rays and electron diffraction.58
Our knowledge of the compounds of A- and B-group metals we
owe mainly to a series of papers by E. Zintl and his coliabor-

at or^,^^ and also to C. W. Stillwell,*O A. Baroni?1 and A. Rossi!,
The numerous structures studied fall into four main types :
(1) The simplest is the CsCl type, which appears for Lag,
LiT1, LiHg, MgAg, MgT1, CaT1, and SrT1.
(2) NaTl structure. This is a very interesting new struc-
ture. The cell is a double body-centred structure with 8 atoms
of each kind. But each kind o€ atom occupies the positions
of a diamond lattice (000, $$$, etc. and 444, Qfg, etc.). Each
atom has therefore four neighbours of its own kind and four of
the other kind, all at the same distance. It is clear that such
a structure should only occur when the atomic radii of both
atoms are nearly alike. It is, in fact, found for LiZn, LiCd,
LiGa, LiIn, NaIn, and NaTl, where the greatest radius differ-
ence is 0.2 A. Thus in these compounds the alkali metals
appear to be compressed down to the size fixed by this B-group
metal.
(3) A number of alloys of formula AB,, where A is Ca, Sr,
La, and Ce, and B is Sn, T1, or Pb, form cubic structures based
on a face-centred lattice of B in which one atom is replaced
by A.
(4) Mg,Ge, Mg,Sn, and Mg2Pb have the anti-CaF, structure.
Other more complex structures have been found, as KBi,
with the MgCu, structure, a framework of bismuth atoms in
the large holes of which are the potassium atoms ; and Na,Pb,
LaAl,, and Li,Sn with large cells.
Sub-metallic.
Adamantine Compounds.-The structure of the hexaborides of
formula B,M, where M = Ca, Sr, Ce, etc., mentioned in the last
report as possessing an anomalous ion BE, has now been shown
by F. Laves83 to be really adamantine, consisting of a covalent-
linked B lattice with the metal atoms in the interstices. Each
B atom has five B neighbours, one at 1.66 and four at 1-76 A.,
and four metal neighbours. Each metal atom has 24 B neighbours.
This 4:24 co-ordination is the highest yet found. Essentially
similar compounds have been shown by A. Schleede and M. Well-

mannS4 to be formed by the action of alkali metals on graphite.
Compounds C,K and C,,K are formed with potassium atoms
between each layer or between alternate layers of the normal
graphite structure. All kinds of carbon so far examined have
been shown to possess a graphite structure. The differences
between the physical and chemical properties of different varieties
are mainly due to the crystal size, which may in the extreme case
of highly active carbon from benzene be only three layers thick
and six condensed benzene rings wide, as U. Hofmann s5 has shown.
Other work86 shows the importance of the edges of the crystallites
in absorption and catalytic activity.
Homopolar Crystals of Fifth- and Sixth-group Elements.-Through
the work of the last two years the gap represented by our ignorance
of the structures of this important group of “sulphide ores” has
been largely abolished. It is now possible to present a fairly ordered
picture of structure types, and to begin to construct a thio-chemistry
equivalent to the oxygen chemistry of the silicates. Thio-structures
differ @om oxy-structures, owing to the larger size and greater
polarisability of the S (Se, P, As, etc.) atoms, so that except for
alkali compounds they are not ionic. The packing is generally
closer, owing to increased vitn der Waals forces, but this is offset
by the smaller co-ordination number of the metal atoms-generally
4 or 6. The homopolar bonds formed are easily ionised, giving
the whole crystal a metallic or semi-metallic character. Sulphide
ores have long been studied by means of their reflecting power,
and recently F. C. PhillipsS7 has shown that, just as in the case
of ionic crystals, the molecular refractivities calculated from the
reflecting power are additive functions of those of the atoms. This
shows the relative unimportance of structural considerations. On
the whole, the structures correspond to those of simple oxides or
halides. Thio-salt complex groups, such as SbS,, do not exist in
the crystal as separate individuals, but fuse into chains or net-
works. The general scheme can be set out as follows in order of
increasing sulphur content, References are only given to struc-
tures determined in the last two years.

This is the typical form for monosulphides, etc., of the

CuS (covelline) is a bright blue mineral strongly pleo-
chroic ; the structure, determined by I. Oftedal,96 helps

AaB,, Stibnite type. The extremely important structure oE Sb,S,
and Bi,S, has at last been analysed, by W. Hofmann.2
The crystals are orthorhombic; a, b, c are 11-20, 11.28,
3-83 B., containing four molecules, space group DBX-
Pbnm, with all the atoms on the symmetry planes. The
most important feature is the existence of bands of
antimony and sulphur atoms linked by primary valencies
lying along the c-axis in the (010) plane. This explains
at the same time both the needle-shaped habit and the
excellent cleavage, and is most interesting among the
sulphides as analogous to the asbestos-like structures in
the silicates.
ABC2. The structure of Sb,S3 is repeated in some thioantimonates
also studied by Hofmann; CuSbS, and CuBiS, contain
Sb-S chains: that of AgSbS, and TlAsS, is more com-
plicated.

are arranged in molecules. H. Parker and W. White-
house 13 have made a very exact Fourier analysis of
FeS,; Fe is found to carry 26 electrons, indicating the
essentially non-ionic nature of this compound. The
distance S-S is 2-14 A., and FeS is 2-26 A. Similar
conclusions were reached by M. Biierger for FeAs,,
which has the marcasite structure.

(3). Molybdenum sulphide type, MoS,, WS,. Both of thew
are layer lattices.
It is clear that this survey of the sulphides is not complete, but
it does at any rate show the main lines on which sulphur com-
pounds are built.
Ionic Crystals.
The interest in ionic crystals continues unabated-over 250
papers have been published on them alone-l-ut as now the main
structural types have been fixed, interest has shifted to points
with other than purely crystallographic interest, such as the rela-
tions of oxides and hydroxides, the r61e of water, or the structure
of complex ions.
Halides, Oxides, and Hydroxides.-A new fact has been added to
the structural relations of the alkali halides by G. Wagner and
L. Lippert's observation that cmium chloride changes its struc-
ture into that of sodium chloride above 450". The small energy
difference between these structures is thus experimentally confirmed.
The most interesting halide structures which have been inves-
tigatedrecently are those of cadmium, mercury, and lead. J. M. Bij-
voet and W. Nieuwenkampg have shown that cadmium bromide,
which, when sublimed has the cadmium chloride structure, when
precipitated appears in the form of a statisticad mixture of the
chloride and the iodide structure ; the interleavings cannot be
more than of the order of one or two layers thick. Incidentally,
0. Hassel lo has shown that the actual structure of cadmium iodide
has a cell double that of the hitherto accepted structure. Complete
analyses have also been made of the structures PbF,,11 PbC1,,12

PbBr2,13 PbClF,1* PbBrE’.15 The first three are isomorphous.
They may be considered as layer lattices which have been distorted
into an approximation to a fluoride 8 :4 -co-ordination structure,
owing to the large size and polarisability of the cation. Actually,
the co-ordination is 9 : 4 or 5, each lead atom having three bromine
atoms at 3.0 and three at 3.2 8.,a ll on one side, while on the
other it has one at 3.3 and two at 4-1 A. There is no evidence for
a semi-molecular association of lead bromide. The chlorofluoride
structure is particularly interesting as a typical sandwich structure,
layers of lead fluoride in fluorite arrangement alternating with a,
lead chloride layer lattice of the tetragonal lead oxide type. Curi-
ously enough, lead chlorofluoride has been known for a long time
as the mineral matlockite Pb,OCl,, but its X-ray pattern led to
its identification, and a new analysis showed that fluorine had
been taken for oxygen. H. BraekkenI6 has shown that mercuric:
bromide has a somewhat complicated layer structure also without
molecules.
More work has been done on AX, compounds. The trifiuorides
of Al, Fe, Co, Rh, Pd, etc., do not, like the trichlorides, form close-
packed layer lattices,l’ but approximate to a cubic lattice whose
corners are occupied by the cations, while the anions occupy the
mid-point of an edge between two cations. The structure of
aluminium fluoride, analysed by J. A. A. Ketelaar,l* shows a
rhombohedra1 cell containing two such units distorted in an attempt
to fill the large holes in the cell centres. These holes can be occupied
with water in the zeolite fashion ; 2AlF3,H20o nly loses its molecule
of water at a red heat.
N. Wooster 19 has pointed out the essential isomorphism between
ferric fluoride and tungsten trioxide (see Ann. Reports, 1931, 28,
296), with which rhenium trioxide 2o bas been shown to be iso-
morphous. These two structures are the analogues in 6:2 40-
ordination of the 4 : 2-co-ordination structures of beryllium fluoride
and silica. As in them, the cation can be replaced by one of lower
charge, the extra charge being made up by an ion in the vacant
spaces. Thus

A stranger case is that of the tungsten bronzes studied by W. F. de
Jong : 21 here the neutral WO, structure takes up a variable amount
of metallic sodium in its interstices, giving highly coloured com-
pounds whose physical properties would be worth investigating.
Another form of substitution is the replacement of two cations by
one of higher and one of lower charge. Thus, as Goldschmidt
predicted, BPO, and BAsO, 22 have essentially the cristobalite
structure of silica. This is particularly interesting, as in most
compounds boron appears as 3-co-ordinated.
The cristobalite structure, the cubic high-temperature form of
silica, has been much studied. T. F. W. Barth23h as shown that
both in cubic p-, stable above 240", and orthorhombic cc-cristobalite,
the oxygen atoms do not lie, as was previously thought, on the line
between two silicons, but definitely to one side. Thus, in all cases
where oxygen is found co-ordinated to two cations, we find that
the lines joining it to them are always inclined at about 140",
indicating the effect of covalent binding tending towards a valency
angle of 109". I. Levin and E. Ott 24 first noticed that opal con-
tains at ordinary temperatures p- or high-temperature cristobalite.
As R. B. Sosman25 has shown, here can be no question of delayed
inversion. J. Grieg,26 however, has pointed to the probable ex-
planation. In opal, as in some glasses, the cristobalite is closely
adherent to an amorphous matrix. Now, at transition from p- to
a-,t here is normally a contraction of about 4% by volume. Either,
therefore, the p-cristobalite inverts and breaks away from its matrix,
as it has been observed to do in certain circumstances, or it fails
to invert and continues to exist as the stable form under permanent
tension (negative pressure) from the matrix. In the Report'ers'
opinion this negative pressure is sufficient to account for the
appearance of p-cristobalite rather than any other form of silica-
all with smaller specific volumes-in the slow dehydration of
massive silica gel, even if the temperature has never been above
the transformation point at 198-270". If this is so, it offers
@-+a!
some interesting possibilities for finding the negative-pressure forms
of other materials. Through the work of M. von Stackelberg and
R. Paulus 88 tcf- 89) we know some of the properties of the ions N3-, P3-.

have been shown to possess the anti-C-sesyuioxide type : i.e., the
ions Mg2 and N3- occupy respectively the positions of 02-a nd Mn3 t-
in Mn203. From this, the radii of N3- and P3- are found to be 1.4
and 1435 A,, very slightly larger than those of 02- and S2- respect-
ively. The free ions have, of course, far larger radii, but their
extreme compressibility almost compensates for this.
We are now beginning to see the place of hydroxides in crystal
chemistry. The strongly polar nature of the hydroxyl group (OH)
leads in every case so far examined to a position unsymmetrically
surrounded by cations, and in particular to layer lattices. The
structure of lithium hydroxide determined by T. Fhnst 27 proves to
be the simplest tetragonal layer lattice of the lead oxide type.
Aluminium hydroxide (hydrargillite) is also a layer lattice, but the
structure determined by (Miss) H. D. Megaw 28 is far more com-
plex. Zinc hydroxide in its stable form, analysed by R. Corey and
R. W. G.W yckoff ,29 is not a layer lattice, but each hydroxyl is sur-
rounded by two zinc atoms on one side and two hydroxyl ions on the
other, while each zinc has four hydroxyl neighbours. An unstable
form exists with a layer lattice, as shown by W. Feitknecht,3O and
this forms sandwich structures with zinc halides, carbonates, and
sulphates.
In all cases there seems to be a definite attraction between two
hydroxyl gro0ups attache d of different cations, as shown in the
inset, and this attraction increases with
the polarising power of the cation, and
@@ consequently with the degree of polaris-
@
ation of the hydroxyl group, as shown by
the decrease in inter-hydroxyl distances (pi.) in the series
Li(0H) (3.61) Ca(OH), (3.36) Mg(OH), (3.22)
Zn(O H), (2.83) Al(O H), (2.79) B(O H), (2.65)
It is clear that the apparent neutrality of the hydroxyl groups to
each other in lithium hydroxide has been replaced by a powerful
attraction in the case of boric acid, which is only less than that of
a.
hydrogen-bond-linked oxygens of acids, 2-55 (see Ann. Reports,
1931, 28, 291). This new kind of bond, which may be called the
double hydrogen bond, still requires theoretical explanation, as the
simple dipole effect should give increased repulsion rather than
attraction.

A most fascinating field has been opened in the study of the
conversion of hydroxides into oxides. The mechanism in magnesium
hydroxide has been already commented on (see p. 386). That of
the trihydroxides of aluminium and iron is yet more complicated
and interesting. This has been investigated by a great number of
workers, by X-ray and magnetic methods. Both metals form two
series of hydroxides and oxides, usually known as a and y. In
each series are a trihydroxide M(OH),, a monohydroxide MO(OH),
and an oxide M20,. Relationships between them are shown in the
scheme :

The figures in parentheses are the volumes occupied per oxygen atom. The
value for close-packed oxygen atoms would be 13.7 A.3.
The a-series is the more stable with smaller atomic volume; the
y-series, on the other hand, is the one usually formed from pre-
cipitation, and is more chemically active. The structure of the
ar-trihydroxides has not been determined; it may be similar to that
of zinc hydroxide. That of the a-monohydroxides, diaspore and
goethite, has been established by M. Deflandre 34 (p. 386)3 31 and
S. Goldsztaub.s2 It is essentially a structure of hexagonal close-
packed oxygens with metal atoms in octahedral holes. Oxygens
and hydroxyls are distinguished by being symmetrically or asjm-
metrically surrounded by metal atoms. On dehydration, it passes
into a parallel aggregate of corundum or hEmatite crystals, a struc-
ture similarly close packed.
The y-trihydroxides, hydrargillite and y-Pe(O H),, are layer struc-
tures (see above, p. 401); on dehydration, they pass without loss
of crystal structure into the monohydroxides bohmite (the chief
mineral of bauxite ores) and lepidocrocite (rubinglimmer or common
rust).s The structure of these is not fully worked out, but it is
clearly a layer lattice cleaving readily, probably across double
hydrogen bonds. Its birefringence is strongly negative, 0.57, while

that of goethite is only 0.14 35 (P-386). Lepidocrocite is also formed
by the oxidation of Fe(OH),,34 by the normal rusting of iron,35
and by the hydrolysis of ferrites36 (MO,Fe,O,) into which it, but
not goethite?' can be reversibly reconverted. On dehydration,
bohmite and lepidocrocite pass into a parallel aggregate of y-Al,O,
or y-3Fe,03, cubic with a spinel structure 38 containing extra oxygen
atoms (see Ann. Reports, 1931, 28, 299). The y-Fe203 structure
holds these oxygen atoms so loosely that it loses them in a vacuum
even at 250" and is turned into magnetite, Fe304.36 In oxygen,
on the other hand, it changes at about 600" into the stable cr-PezO,
form. Lepidocrocite is also, as might be expected from its larger
volume, unstable to pressure. 0. Baudisch39 ha8 shown that it
may be converted into a-Fe,03 by grinding at room temperature.
Fe(OH), is also unstable, undergoing slow autoxidation even when
kept under anGrobic conditions.
The most striking property distinguishing the and the y-series M-
is ferromagnetism, which is characteristic of the latter. The occur-
rence of this phenomenon in purely ionic compounds is of great
theoretical interest, particularly from the point of view of their
magneto-optics, but so far no single-crystal work has been reported.
Apart from the y-series, a number of ferrites show ferromagnetic
properties. The nature of these ferrites has been studied, especially
by H. Forestier 42 and S. Hil~ert.~OT hey are all of the mixed oxide
type, of general formula mM0,nFe,03, where M is Li,, Na,, K,, Be,
Mg, Cu, Sr, Ba, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Pb, AI213, Sn,,,. Most of these
are ferromagnetic, some with exceptionally low Curie points : for
LiFeO, and NaFeO, it lies below - 70". Some have special struc-
tures, e.g., LiFeO, with a rock-salt structure with iron and lithium
indistinguishable (see p. 382), NaFeO, 41 with a layer lattice of FcO,'
separated by large Na' ions, and a-BeFe,0,42 with a lepidocrocitc
structure with beryllium replacing two hydrogens. The great
majority have spinel-like structures, but with extremely variable
composition, Sr0,2Pe2O, showing the same structure as SrO,SFe,O,,

suggesting that the structure is simply a stabilised y-Fe,O, structure.
It is interesting to note that the maximum of ferromagnetism is not
reached for the true spinel M0,Fe,03, but for an iron-richer solid
solution 2M0,3Fe203. Others, such as 2Mt10,3Fe,O3, P-BeO,Fe2O3,
and SnO,,Fe,O,, show the or-Fe203 structure, and are not ferro-
magnetic. It seemed natural to conclude that the ferromagnetism
was a structural property of the y-series, but there are several
indications that this is not the case,39~4n0o tably the work of G.
Kurdjumov and his collaborators,43 who prepared ferromagnetic
mFe203i n an alloy. It is more probable that here, as in metallic
ferromagnetics, structure plays a secondary rble, the internal
electronic state of the ion being primary. In ionic compounds ferro-
magnetism seems to be associated with the state of iron functioning
as ferrous acid, probably the net acid y-FeO,' H'. It is noticeable
that the oxidation product of Fe(OH), is ferromagnetic or not,
according as the medium is alkaline or acid.34
The oxide-hydroxide relations of cobalt 44 are essentially similar
to those of iron; those of manganese are more complicated, as
solid transformations between Mn2+,M n3+,a nd Mn4 t are all possible.
The transformations
-+ --+ Mn(QH), MnO(0H) MnO,
Pyrochroite Manganite Pyrolusite (Polianite)
WOH), a-AlO(OH) TiO,
Structure Pseudo-structure Ruth structure
all take place without any essential change in crystal structure.45
The products in all these cases are, however, microcrystalline, as
they are formed below their recrystallising temperatures : they
consequently possess large surface and high chemical reactivity.
These oxide-hydroxide transformations are beginning to become
intelligible through crystal a.nalysis. It should now be possible to
attack the related problem of the colloidal hydroxides (e.g., those
of aluminium, iron, manganese, etc.) so important for physical,
bio- and geo-chemistry.
Mixed Oxides.- Of mixed oxides ttic spinel structures have
already been discussed (see p. 382). The more complex structures
of the pyrochlorite group have also been much studied. This
structure bids fair to rival that of spinels in its stability and variety
of composition. Its essential formula is [A]:-*[B]:O7 (see Ann.
Reports, 1931, 28, 299), with a cubic cell a z 10.3 8.,b ut the struc-

ture can take up at least one atom of oxygen and four of water
without swelling noticeably. The essential feature of the structure
is the 6-co-ordinated Sb5r ion (which may be replaced by Nb5+,
Ta5', Ti4+ etc.). As L. Pauling 46 has pointed out, antimony never
appears in any less than 6-co-ordination, and among acid-forming
ions we should distinguish sharply between the 3-co-ordination of
(B)3+C, 4 t, N5+, the 4-co-ordination of (Al)3+, Si4+, (Ge)4 r , P5+,A s5 r,
S6+, Se6+,C Vf, Br74, V5+, Cr6+,M n7+ and the 6-co-ordination of
Sn4I-,S b5+, Te6b, I7'-, Fe34-, Ti4'-, (Zr)4+,N b"'-, Ta5i-, Mo6+, W6+,
Re7+. (The elements in parentheses are borderline cases; Mo6+
and W6+ are anomalous.) G. Natta and M. Baccaredda47 have
shown that not only some but all the calcium atoms in Ca,Sb,O,
can be replaced by $Sb,O, so that the structure of Sb,04 really
belongs to the pyrochlorite group, and should be written as
Sbi+Sbi+O,, just as Fe304 is Fe2+Fei+04. Further work on this
group has been done by 3'. Machatschki 48 and others.49
8iZicutes.-Since the main outlines of silicate chemistry are known
(Ann.R eports, 1931,28,301),m ost of the work done in the past two
years has been concerned with anomalous or very complex silicates,
of mineralogical rather than of chemical interest. The exception
is the determination by W. H. Taylor of the structure of sanidiiic,
(K,Na)AlSi,O,, which gives the key to that of the petrologically
essential group the felspars, and thus closes the last important gap
in our knowledge of silicate types. As anticipated, it proves to be
based on a somewhat collapsed (Si3A108)1- framework, in the
interstices of which are found the alkali atoms. Among the more
complicated silicates studied are those of hemimorphite 52 and
bertranditeB by T. Ito and J. West, euclase by J. Biscoe and
B. Warren,54 and zunyite by L. Pa~ling.5~A ll are hydroxy-
silicates, but in no case are the hydroxyl ions attached to silicon, but
to zinc, beryllium, or aluminium. The silicate grouping is different

Complex Ions.-The work of the last two years, represented by
over 100 papers, now makes it possible to review the types of com-
plex ion in a wider and more rational scheme. In the first place, it
is necessary to have a physical definition of a complex ion. The
most general is : a charged group of atoms (closed or open) for each
atom of which the forces attaching it to the group are greater than
the forces attaching it to other atoms. Applying Pauling’s rules to
the simplest case of an ion of the type Bb+X:-, we can see that this
will always be a definite complex ion if b/n>x/2, for here the partial
valency joining B to X, being greater than half the charge of X, no
other valency can equal it. For oxy-ions the rule is simplest :
an atom will always give a stable oxy-ion when its maximum valency
is greater than its co-ordination number ; e.g., C4+03,P 5+041, 7+06.
For fluoride ions, twice the valency must be greater than the co-
ordination number; e.g., B3+F4, Si4+F6. This rule gives a lower
limit to the stability. Ions with weaker internal forces can, how-
ever, exist in f avourable circumstances, i.e. , in the presence of large
ions such as K’ or Cl’. This is the case with co-ordinated ions of
the type Ni(NO,):-. Oxy-ions of this type, however, inevitably
-+
hydrolyse in water, e.g., Sn0;- Sn(OH)i-. The ions for which
b/n = x/2 tend to polymerise by sharing X atoms. Thus (B3+03)3-

(Si0J2- chains, etc. ; AlFi- and WOE- give framework structures.
Where there are homopolar forces inside the ion, as in organic and
quasi-organic ions, e.g., the dithionate ion, the question of ionic
stability merges into that of molecular stability.
Ions can be divided into mononuclear and polynuclear types.
The former are of the general form B&[n = (0),1,2,3,4,6]; the
latter consist of mononuclear ions bound together either (a)t hrough
X atoms (generally 0),o r (b) by covalent bonds between B atoms.
The (a) type are represented by pyro- and per-ions and by the
silicates; (b) by most organic ions. We limit by convention
inorganic polynuclear ions to those which are fairly compact and
symmetrical in structure. The simple mononuclear ions are sym-
metrical and linear, triangular, tetrahedral, or octahedral in shape.
From them we can derive asymmetrical ions, either by removing X
atoms, leaving a reduced ion with electron pairs (Zachariasen’s

principle, see Ann. Reports, 1931, 28, 297), or by choosing different
kinds of X atoms, by substituting, e.g., F, S, or N for 0 in an oxy-
ion.65 The substitution of hydrogen to form a hypo-ion is an
extreme case of this. The substitution of hydroxyl for oxygen or
simple addition of hydrogen ion, leading to an acid ion or acid, does
not change the form, or, in general, the symmetry of the ion, owing
to the partial ionisation of the hydrogen in a hydrogen bond.
Two types of anomaly are apparent : those such as SeBrg- and
VPl-, where the co-ordination is normal but the valency too low,
and those such as W0:- and OsOj, where the valency is normal but
the co-ordination too low.
Crystal-structural investigations have been able to throw con-
siderable light on the nature of co-ordinated ions. A. Ferrari and
C. Colla6' have measured a series of salts containing the ions
[Co(N0,),l3- and [Ni(N0,)6]4-. All form cubic face-centred cells,
a z 10 A.,d etermined by the complex ions, various numbers of
K,NH,,Ba,Pb, etc., filling the interstices of the structure. Complete
analysis was not attempted, but the published dimensions of the
cell exclude, in the Reporters' opinion, the possibility of an electro-
static co-ordination Co+ -ONf and are only compatible with a
-0
0
covalent Co-NO co-ordination.
The square planar configuration of the PtX, and PdX, ions, which
can be considered as derived by removing two X atoms from the
octahedral PtX6 ion, has been fully confirmed by structure analyses
on single crystals. R. M. Bozorth and L. Pauling68 find planar
configuration in Mg2PtC1,,7H20, while E. G. Cox in a series of
papers 69 demonstrates it in [Pd(NH,),]Cl,,H,O, [Pt(NH,)4]C1,,H,0,

and the Ag(CN), groups found to be linear: this may be regarded
as the last stage in removing substituents from a BX, complex. A
similar linear arrangement has been found by H. M. Powell 73 in the
dialkylthallium ions.
We are not yet in a position to classify the polynuclear ions.
Those of the pyro-type sharing oxygen (or fluorine) are fairly familiar
through the silicates. The most valuable addition is the three
co-ordinated chain ion studied by W. H. Zachariasen 74 in calcium
metaborate (see p. 407). The homopolar type is represented by the
dithionate ion. G. V. Helvig,75 G, Hiigg,76 and M. L. Huggins 77
are now all agreed that the ion consists of two pyramidal SO, groups
joined point to point through the sulphur atoms in octahedral
configuration. The hypophosphate ion, O,P-POi-, is probably
isomorphou~.~In~ connection with the heteropoly phospho-
tungstate ion P(W,O,,);- mentioned in the Report (p. lOS), it should
be noted that, if the structure proposed is correct, it would require
us to modify our conceptions of the laws of ionic structure, for one
02-io n has as neighbours three W6+ ions and one P5+io n, giving it
an equivalent charge of 49 electrons instead of its usual two, whilc
other oxygen ions receive a charge of only one electron.
The Salts.-Apart from information on the nature of ions, much
work of crystal structural interest has been done on the salts. In
ABX, compounds with flat ions, optical anisotropy is an important
property, and has been much studied.79 S. B. HendricksgOh as
published a full account of the changes of structure in ammonium
nitrate due to ion rotation (see Ann. Reports, 1931,28, 291). V. M.

Ann. Reports, 1931,28, 297) ; the mineral constituent of bone and
teeth is shown to be hydroxy-apatite, Ca3(O H)Ca,(PO,),. The
hydroxy-ion is very tightly held, and cannot be removed below

azurite, Cu,( OH),(CO,),, and malachite, Cu,( OH),C03, have been
studied by M.B rasseur.88 The structures are complicated, and are
true hydroxy-carbonates, not sandwich structures, CuCO,Cu( OH),,

molecules are co-ordinated to the cation, the co-ordination number
being determined by the ionic size. The water molecules act as
distributors of the ionic charge, each touching two oxygens of
different SO, groups carrying an electrostatic valency of S and & in
the beryllium and nickel sulphates respectively, each sulphate
oxygen being accordingly touched by two water molecules belonging
to different beryllium ions or three belonging to different nickel ions,

Moleczclar Crystals.
Although X-ray methods were from the beginning used to study
molecular and, in particular, organic crystals, it is only in the last
few years that they have begun to yield information of positive value
to chemists. This was because, owing to the intrinsic difficulties of
organic crystal analysis, the results obtained were in the case of
simpler compounds too rough to do more than confirm the chemical
evidence, while compounds where information of any kind would
be of use were generally too complicated in structure to yield to
the X-ray methods of the time.
Now, however, improvements in crystal analysis technique and a
more extensive knowledge of the nature of molecules and of intra-
and inter-molecular forces have changed all this, and results
already achieved justify the claim of crystal analysis as an important
and ultimately essential adjunct to structural chernistr~.~E~ve ry
stage in the crystal analysis of a molecular compound may be of value
from the chemical standpoint. These stages may be summarised
as follows :
(1) X-Ray photograph of the crystal, either as powder or single
crystal. This is a very powerful means of identification. The
angular positions and the intensities of the reflexions are equivalent
to so many characteristics, each of the value of a melting point or
other single physical determination. It has been used, for instance,
in showing the substantial identity of adenine hydrochloride with a
preparation of vitamin-B, (p. 424).
(2) Determination of cell size. This, in conjunction with a know-
ledge of the density, furnishes the most accurate method of absolute
molecular-weight determination. The limitations of this method
depend only on that of the density, which is difficult with very small
or cracked crystals. The weight obtained is in general some simple
exact multiple, e.g., 2, 4, 6, 8, of the true molecular weight, but this
multiple can be found at the next stage.
(3) Determination of space group and molecular symmetry. This

is effected from X-ra,y photographs combined with a determination
of polarity by piezo- 96 or pyro-electric methods,97 or by etch
figures. The first use to which this information can be put is the
determination of the maximum molecular size. The minimum size
cannot be determined, as all the molecules in a cell may not occupy
crystallographically equivalent positions, even when no polymeris-
ation has taken place. Thus, it is possible to distinguish between
pure substances and molecular compounds, as in the cases of calci-
ferol and quinhydrone (see pp. 423, 420). The actual molecular
symmetry is, of course, of stereochemical importance in many cases,
but here again the crystal analysis only gives a minimum symmetry,
as molecules in general will not be able to pack so as to exhibit their
highest symmetry (cf. benzene, p. 419).
(4) General arrangement of molecules in the cell. For this the
X-ray evidence may be supplemented by evidence from physical
properties-habit, cleavage, etc.-but most importantly by a know-
ledge of the optical or magnetic anisotropy of the crystal. In a
molecular crystal where the intramolecular forces are strong and the
intermolecular forces weak-as in nearly all organic crystals-the
molecule behaves in the crystal very much as in a gas, and con-
sequently the anisotropy of the crystal is a mere product of that of
the individual molecules and of their mutual orientations.
Now the optical (or magnetic) anisotropy of a molecule is closely
related to its shape-long molecules are positive, flat molecules
negative, and round or compact molecules quasi-isotropic. If
molecules pack parallel in a crystal, the optical character of the
crystal is that of the molecules. If, as is more rarely the case, their
axes lie in a plane, the character is inverted, i.e., long molecules
arranged at right angles give negative birefringence. If there is no
selected common direction, quasi-isotropy results for every type of
molecule.
It is nearly always possible from such indications to find the
disposition of the molecules in the crystals, and hence their size and
shape, even when the molecular structure is quite unknown, as has
been done, e.g., for vitamins B, and C (ascorbic acid, see p. 424).
Once the size and shape of the molecule are known, many questions
with respect to its structure can be answered. The method is
essentially a negative one. Of proposed structures, some can be
excluded as having inadmissible shapes, though at this stage it is
impossible to be sure that a given admissible structure is the correct
one. It was in this may that the new sterol formula was first
deduced (see p. 423). The greatest difficulties are encountered

where (u) the molecules are geometrically and optically quasi-
isotropic, (b) intermolecular forces are large, as in poly-alcohols and
acids, (c) the molecule is not rigid but protean in shape, owing to the
existence of internal rotations. Thus the sugars and simple vegetable
acids, where all these disadvantages occur together in varying degree,
have not yielded anything significant to X-ray analysis, compared
to that yielded by aromatic or paraffinoid types.
(5) Determinution of atomic positions. Once the rough positions
of molecules in a crystal are known, the exact positions of the atoms
can be found by a laborious process of trial and error, so as to give
a good agreement between observed and calculated intensities of
reflexion.
(6) Determination of electronic densities (Fourier analysis) (see
Ann. Reports, 1929, 26, 280). Starting from approximate atomic
positions, the phases of the diffracted beams can be found. This
gives their complex amplitude, and hence by Fourier analysis a
complete picture (usually a two-dimensional projection) o€ the
electronic distribution can be obtained (see Figs. 1 and 2). Prom
this, interatomic distances and valency angles can be read off, and
these final values are, owing to the method of successive approxim-
ation used, independent of any original assumptions about the
structure of the molecule.
This chain of operations is divided clearly into two parts, vix.,
(1)-(4) and (5) and (6). The first is straightforward measurement,
involving little calculation, and for any crystal species may take
between a day and a week. The second calls for much experience
and intuition, refined measurements of intensity, and heavy corn-
putations , running into several thousands of operations for one
crystal, and the time taken must be reckoned by months. It is
plain, therefore, that far fewer crystals can be determined by this
complete intensive method than by rapid preliminary methods more
adapted to extensive surveys. The two sides of the work are inter-
dependent. Extensive surveys suggest which crystals will yield
the most useful results if intensively analysed, while the results of
intensive analysis provide data on intra- and inter-molecular
distances useful in building up rough models of crystal structures,
particularly in stage (4).
The chemical implications of these two aspects are also different.
Intensive analysis provides fundamental information on stereo-
chemistry and the nature of the chemical bond. It is one of the
chief means of transformation from the classical qualitative, topo-
logical, chemistry of the nineteenth century to the quantum-
mechanical, metrical chemistry of the present day. The extensive
method is more closely connected with the practical development of

chemistry in analysis and synthesis, particularly in dealing with
complex biochemical problems. Here the chemist and the crystallo-
grapher must work in intimate collaboration. A large number of
related substances and derivatives are prepared and examined, and
from their crystallographic relations more can be discovered than
from an elaborate analysis of any one of them. There is no doubt
that, if chemists were more aware of the possibilities of these
methods, there mould result an enormous saving of time and effort.
Complete analyses of organic crystals are still rare. The work is
a continuation of that of (Sir) W. H. Bragg at the Royal Institution,
chiefly by J. M. Robertson and (Mrs.)K . Lonsdale. Including some
earlier work, particularly that of It. W. G. Wyckoff, thc only crystals
for which complete analyses are available are shown in Tablc I.

With each crystal type are given the intramolecular distances which
can be derived from it. These, together with the 1-54A . distance
derived for the aliphatic bond from diamond, and the value 1-42 A.
for graphite, represent all the determinations of interatomic distances
justifiable by X-ray measurement. Values are quoted by N. V.
Sidgwick 08 for many other bonds, but, except where they depend on
spectral data for symmetrical diatomic molecules, they are of the
nature of predictions only. This is particularly the case for distances
derived from electron diffraction, except for the simplest molecules
of the BX, type, where they are least liable to interpretative error.
A summary of this work is given by L. Bru.'
The table also contains values of intermolecular distances, but
these have not the same precise significance. For most organic
molecular compounds covered by neon-like electronic orbitals (other
forms occur only in compounds containing sulphur, chlorine, etc.)
the distance between atoms in neighbouring molecules is determined
primarily by residual (van der Waals) forces leading to a common

value of about 36---4.0~\.T his is only slightly greater than the
distance 3.41 8. between the hydrogen-less molecular sheets of
graphite. The presence of hydrogen atoms does not affect the
distance much, as they are embedded in the electronic cloud of the
atoms to which they are bound. If, however, they are part of a local
dipole, as in hydroxy- or amino-groups, the interatomic distance
may be reduced to 3-3.2,&., or in the extreme case of acids, a
hydrogen bond may reduce it to 2-55 8.
All other work on molecular compounds is either of crystal
physical interest, as showing how known molecules pack in a crystal,
or of direct analytic interest, as leading to a structural formula
which still remains to be proved by chemical methods. The results
may be classified under : (1) Simple molecular compounds, includ-
ing not only inorganic molecules, but organic compounds with
compact molecules (pentaerythritol derivatives, etc.) . (2) Long-
chain molecules. (3) Ring molecules, simple, multiple, and con-
densed.
Simple MoZecukcr CrystaZs.-Much work has been done on hydridc
structures.l Although the essential picture is that of close packing
(Ann. Reports, 1931, 28, 303), yet in almost very case there exist
low-temperature forms with lower symmetry, usually tetragonal.
The transitions in the solid are clearly due to dipole rotation, as has
been shown by C. S. Hitchcock,2b y the appearance of high dielectric
constants at the transition temperatures, the only temperature at
which the molecules are neither freely rotating nor fixed, and can thus
respond to the electric field. Similar effects have long been known
for ice and the alcohols, but curiously enough are not found for solid
ammonia. M. Ruhemann has shown that a-nitrogen (above 35" K.)
is hexagonal close packed, as against the cubic close packing of
a-nitrogen. The molecular polyhalides of the types BX,, BX,,
BX,, BX, have been studied in the solid by X-raysYa4n d in the liquid
and vapour both by X-ray and electron methods. Electron

methods have also been used by K. Wierl and L. Bru for a whole
set of simple molecules, hydrocarbons, halides, ethers, etc. In all
these cases the structure determination depends on the interpre-
tation of a small number of diffuse diffraction rings; it can only be
of value in the simplest cases, and then only for the measurement of
rough interatomic distances and valency angles. A very interesting
application of electron diffraction is, however, shown by A. Stock
and R. Wierl’s 8 work on the compound B,N,H,, which shows the
same pattern as benzene, and should therefore be formulated as in
(I). Other such cyclic inorganic compounds have been investigated.
H H
(PNCI,), and (PNCl,), have been shown by F. M. Jaeger to have
the structures like (11); S,N, and H,S,N, lo are apparently more
compact. Most interesting, however, is further light on the struc-
ture of sulphur.ll E. Hertel l2 has shown, by examination of the
trigonal molecular compounds CHI3,3S,, As13,3S,, that the S,
molecules not only have a plane of symmetry but must be piled
above each other in the direction of the c-axis at a mutual distance
of 4.44 A. This is only compatible with a disc-shaped molecule of
external diameter z 6.6 and thickness z 4.4 d. The most probable
configuration is therefore a cyclic molecule derived from a cube
flattened into a puckered octagon. A more careful analysis of this
compound would give more information on the nature of the sulphur
molecule than a study of the element itself.
G. Wagner and G. Dengel l3 have investigated the tetrahalides of
pcntaerythritol, finding simple cells with halogen atoms lying in
planes, but the Reporters have reason to believe that the real struc-
tures are more complicated. The only other apparent exception found
by X-ray analysis to the tetrahedral carbon atom is that of dibenzyl-
idenepentaerythritol (see Ann. Reports, 1929, 26,304),th e molecule

~ymrnetry.1~O ne of the Reporters l5 has recently found that this
is incorrect, as the crystal is really trigonal, not hexagonal, and in
the molecule consequently only one diad was of symmetry, which
is fully compatible with the tetrahedral carbon atom.
R. W. G. Wyckoff and R. B. Corey have continued their work on
urea and its derivatives thiourea l7 and methylurea,l8 and have
furnished valuable precise interatomic measurements (see Table I)
and also P curves for carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen. F. V. Lenel19
has continued his work on the polypeptides. Glutathione, the
basic respiratory peptide, has been examined by J. D. Bernal,20
who has shown that its three amino-acid units are arranged in a
straight chain.
E. G. Cox 21 is making progress in the field of the sugars, but so
far the difficulties have been too great to put forward any complete
structure.
Long-chain Compounds.-A. Miiller 22 has shown that the cyclo-
paraffins C,H,, (n = 12-30) are essentially similar to the normal
parafhs in structure, the flexible ring being drawn out under the
influence of residual forces into a double chain with a small ring
involving 1-3 carbon atoms at each end. The cross-section of the
straight part of the ring is 37.5 almost exactly double that of a
free paraffin, vix., 18.3 k2.M ore remarkable are the apparently
greater intermolecular forces, especially in the low-carbon members :
cycZododecane has, for instance, a density of 0-945 compared to 0.77
for dodecane. The rotation of the carbon chains of the paraffins in
the solid state has been well established by his further work,23
showing that it is complicated by other forms of polymorphism for
hydrocarbons higher than C24. These rotational forms have been
studied optically for hydrocarbons a’nd alcohols by N. Yannaquis 24
and J. D. Berna1,25 where they appear as uniaxial hexagonal crystals.

almost certainly planar, but the best evidence for this comes from
the study of more complex aromatic structures, in particular durene,
1 : 2 : 4 : 5-tetramethylbenzene, for which a complete Fourier
analysis was carried out by J. M. Robertsona5 (see p. 413 and
Figs, 1 and 2). It is interesting to note that the mutual repulsion
of methyl groups in the o-positions made them deviate from the
radial orientation. Other benzene derivatives have been less
thoroughly studied. p-Dichlorobenzeneh as been already mentioned
(p. 382). The plane of symmetry reported for m-dinitrobenzene 36
(see Ann. Reports, 1931,28,306) has now been shown by piezoelectric
measurement 96 not to exist. Of particular interest are the struc-
tures of quinone, corrected from optical and magnetic measurements
by K. S. Krishnan and S. Banerjee?' and that of quinhydrone
determined by 0. R. Foz and J. Palacios.38 The cell is monoclinic,
space group Cih - PZ,/n, but in it there is only one molecule of
quinone, and one of quinol, and these must be derivable from each
other by a symmetry axis. The only coizclusion is that here we havc
to do with no molecular compound, but with a new type of chain
polymeride held together by hydrogen bonds :
This would explain both the peculiar oxidation-reduction properties
of the substance, and its extreme optical pleochroism. The crystals
are practically black for vibration directions along the macro-
molecule, even when transparent and showing Newton's colours for
the other vibration. In vapour and solution, ring polymerisation
may take the place of chain polymerisation.
The most complex benzene derivative studied is the mineral

lie in a flat ring.

has also published a Fourier analysis of p-diphenylbenzene (cf.
Hertel) ,45 and preliminary results for pdiphenyldiphenyl40 (bis-
diphenylyl). In these compounds the structure found shows that
the benzene rings are flat hexagons which in any one molecule lie in
the same plane. The value for the distance C-C between the rings
was 1.48 pi., ie., intermediate between those observed in aromatic
and in aliphatic carbon atoms. The implication is that the Ph-Yh
bond does not easily admit of rotation. This is further confirmed by
the analysis of s-triphenylbenzene by (Mrs.) K. L0nsdale,~6w here
a11 rings lie in a plane.
In a similar way J. M. Robertson 47 has established the structure
of the basic condensed ring systems naphthalene 47 and anthracenq48
and with J. Iball 49 extended this study to chrysene and 1 : 2 : 5 : 6-
(1i benzanthracene. Condensed ring systems form flat rigid mole-
cules, which with increasing number of rings tend to pack more and
more in parallel sheets approximating to the structure of graphite.
Stilbene, tolane, and o-azotoluene have been described by 1LI.
Pra~ad.~T*h e crystals all show similarities with those of azo-
benzene. The -N=N- and -CEC- are equivalent in length
within the errors of experimental measurement, -C=C- is some-
what longer. To this group also belong the aromatic disulphides

rather larger than the values S = 1-04, Se = 1-13A . found in the
elements. This is probably the half length of the S-S (Se-Se) single
bond. The straight character of dibenzyl derivatives is maintained
for similar multiple-linked phenyl groups such as dibenzylidene-
benzidine or diethyl pp’-xylylidenebisaminocinnamate,a s shown by

thc work of' J. 1). Hwid 52 and K. Herrinmn53 on tho crystal
structures of substances giving rise to liquid crystals.
E. Hertel* and his co-workers have examined a number of the
substitution products of trinitrobenzene, and also several molecular
compounds.55 It seems a pity that in this work the optical proper-
ties of the crystals generally are not measured, as these should assist
in the structure determination far more than the theories of mole-
cular packing put forward. This is particularly the case with the
interesting observations on colour dimorphism in which one might
correlate change of colour with the actual alteration in the mutual
arrangements of chain and ring systems rather than with chemical
interaction. Among condensed ring systems, J. Hengstenberg and
J. Palacios56 have shown that the two anthracene molecules in
dianthracene are probably linked at the 9 : 9'-positions, the anthra-
cene ring system being slightly bent at thc centre to enable this
linking to take place.
There has been a, certain increase in X-ray measurements taken
rather for purposes of identification of the compounds than for
structure determinations. A very complete series is that of deriv-
atives of ephedrine and $-ephedrine:' where the measurements
should prove sufficiently complete to lead ultimately to the exact
structures.
In the last two years a number of important groups of biochemical
compounds, the sterols, the bile acids, the female and the male
sexual hormones, as well as other substances, pre-mandiol, digitoxin,
bufotoxin, etc., have been shown to be based on a common condensed
ring system. The establishment of this common skeleton was due
initially to X-ray investigation of one of its more complex members,
calciferol (vitamin D). The chemical proofs of the new sterol
formula are dealt with in another part of these Reports (p. 198), but
it is here of some importance to state precisely how the methods of
crystal analysis were of use in settling difficul6 points or indicating
possible lines of attack. The following summary is arranged in
roughly chronological order.

(I) 'l'bt: first crystal structural investigatioii of calciferol aid its
related compounds 58 and of cholesterol and ergosterol showed (a) on
the evidence of the space group and number of molecules in the cell,
that calciferol was a simple substance (see p. 412) ; (b) on evidence
of cell size and optically determined molecular orientation, that the
sterol molecule must occupy a space 5 x 7.2 x 17-20 A. and must
form in the crystal a double layer similar to that of long-chain
alcohols. This showed that the accepted skeleton (111) must be
wrong in at least two essential points : (i) the sharing of one carbon
atom by rings I, 11, and 111, for this would lead to a much thicker
molecule, and (ii)t heattachmentof thelong chain at C,,, which would
lead to a much shorter molecule than that observed. Purther,
(iii) the double layer pointed to a hydroxyl group placed terminally
in the molecule. (This was confirmed later by an examination of
$-cholesterol, which with a hydroxyl jn ring I1 shows no double
layer.)
(2) Meanwhile, a concurrent but fortuitously uiidertaken investig-
ation of cestrin 59 pointed strongly to a structure with a phenanthrene
nucleus of approximately the same molecular width and thickness.
A little later it was apparent that pregnandiol,60 which was already
known to be related through the bile acids to the sterols, had also
very similar molecular dimensions.
(3) These were the considerations from crystallography that,
added to the serious chemical defects of the old sterol formula, led
Rosenheim and King61 to propound the new formula (IV) sub-
sequently amended to (V), which accounted for all the features
occurring in the crystal analysis.

thinness of the molecule was made more certain by an examination
of cis- and truns-hexahydrochrysenea6 2 synthesised by G. R. Ramage
and R. Robinson, of which only the former showed no resemblance
to a sterol derivative.
(5) The attempt to settle the nature, 5- or 6-membered, of ring
IV has led to much work on the hydrocarbons derived from the
sterols, in particular Diels's hydrocarbon CI8Hl6. While it has
been impossible to determine its structure, X-ray and optical
methods have shown that it is not cycZopentenophenanthrene,@
and its resemblance to retene suggested the structure y-methyl-
cyczopentenophenanthrene. This was subsequently synthesised by
E. Bergmann64 and by G. A. R. ICon65 and appears to be indis-
tinguishable from the natural product.
(6) Much further work is in progress, in particular on the position
of the double bonds. Here, both X-ray and optical theory66
suggest but cannot prove that in ergosterol these lie in rings I
andlor 11. This is still in opposition to current chcmicd opinion.

Fibre Xtructures.
A discussion of X-ray work on fibres requires a separate report :
here we can only mention the most salient advances of the last two
years. The whole subject has been admirably summed up by
W. T. Astbury in Fundamentals of Fibre Structure (Oxford,
“ ”
1933), and in shorter articles.71
The simplest fibre substances studied are the polyoxymethylenes.
Crystallographic research on these, chiefly carried out by H. W.
Kohlschiitter and L. Sprenger72 and E. Sa~terh,a~s ~be en able
to show precisely how the polymerisation takes place, and has
probably given the clue to the mechanics of polymerisation in all
chain polymeride systems. Trioxymethylene crystallises in the
hexagonal system with six-ring molecules arranged in order along
the hexad axis :
On exposure to light in the presence of free formaldehyde, nuclei
appear in the crystals, and starting from them fibrous polyoxy-
methylene appears, the fibre axis lying along the hexagonal axis,
and with a 9-fold repeat pattern corresponding to the 6-fold repeat
of the trioxymethylene. All that has happened, quite clearly, is an
interchange of homopolar bonds proceeding in a ‘‘ zip fashion,
”
made possible by the previous apposition of the appropriate mole-
cules of the ring polymeride by crystal forces. In this way the
crystals of ring polymerides autocatalyse their transformation to
chain polymerides. This mechanism may prove of very general
application. The apposition of chain polymeride molecules neces-
sary to form fibres may be produced by flow and shear, as has been
very beautifully shown by W. H. Carothers and J. W. Hill74 for

poly-esters. A thread of glassy poly-ester is instantaneously con-
verted by strain into an oriented fibre.
Of carbohydrate polymerides, the literature on cellulose is too
voluminous even to be referred to, but some understanding of the
mechanism of cellulose formation in Nature has been derived by the
study of the cell walls of single cells of the alga Valonia ~entricosa,'~
which have been shown to consist of a double spiral network of
cellulose chains intersecting nearrlya t right angles to give a multi-
"
ply structure of maximum strength. This is probably the case "
in all vegetable cell walls, save that in elongated fibre cells the angle
is reduced to a few degrees. In wood, K. Preudenberg 76 has shown
that the cellulose network is reinforced by interstitial lignin.
The starches have been much studied, particularly by J. R. Katz 77
and his co-workers. The difference between starch and cellulose
is due to the steric inability of the former, derived from a-glucose,
to build straight chains leading to a nearly amorphous structure.
The most generally significant advance, however, is in our under-
standing of the essential nature and classification of proteins.
W. T. Astbury has now shown that the protein, besides its character-
istic peptide chain which can exist in the a-(contracted) or
p-(expanded) form, has also a characteristic thickness and width.
The thickness 4.65 8. between NH and CO in neighbouring chains
is roughly the same for all proteins, but the width corresponds to
bonding between the side chains, and consequently varies with their
length, being only 4.5-6.1 A. in silk fibrin,78a nd up to 9.8 A. in
keratin. Further, the side chains can remain unattached, as in the
soluble proteins like ~valburnenc,~an~ b e attached by ionic linkages
in the gelatinsYs0m yosin, and muscle,s1 or by permanent peptide

or -S-S- linkages in the sclero-proteins such as keratinF2 giving
rise to a semi-rigid ladder-like structure. The extremely complex
physical properties of the proteins, particularly their behaviour on
swelling with water 84 or adsorption on have already
been- qualitatively analysed by this model. Here we have un-
doubtedly the key to the mechanism of movement, if not to the very
existence, of living matter.
After the proteins, the lipoids are of the greatest biological interest.
Here we find liquid-crystal structures playing an important d e ,a s
emphasised by F. This is particularly the case in nerve:’
which has been studied by X-rays in active, narcotised, and de-
generate states. Thus the applications of X-ray technique are
already passing the boundary of biochemistry into physiology and
pathology.
Liquids and Classes.
The methods of X-ray analysis of liquids and amorphous solids
developed by Debye and Prim (see Ann. Reports, 1929, 26, 306)
have been the basis for an extensive study of types of liquid struc-
ture. The two characteristics of a liquid are (a)t he close contact
between the molecules, leading to a relatively dense approximately
close-packed structure ; (b)t he irregular nature of the packing over
distances more than a few molecular diameters. Both these
characters are modified by the temperature and the nature of the
molecules. Higher temperatures produce rotary and translatory
molecular movements, but molecular clustering still occurs up to
and even slightly above the critical point, as shown by the work of
F. H. W. No11 88 on ether. The effect of the nature of the molecules
is more varied. X-Ray analysis distinguishes between small-angle
diffraction due to intermolecular, and large-angle diffraction due to
intramolecular, interference. Further, the small-angle diffraction
is either normal, indicating close packing, or abnormal, indicating a
looser arrangement of molecules, generally brought about by dipole
attractions. The analysis of these offers greater difficulty as it can

and calculating the diffraction to compare with that observed. It
has, however, been attempted in one case, that of where the
basic arrangement is tetrahedral (quartz-like) rather than close-
packed.
Greater anisotropy of molecules leads to clumping in parallel
aggregates, as occurs in nematic liquid crystals which show when
oriented a fibre diagram. Finally they may arrange themselves in
layers, generally curved, as in smectic liquid crystals which show one
set of crystal plane refiexions. (Between these and true crystals are
still other intermediate stages; see below.) The general scheme is
shown below:
1. Atomic liquids : Hg, Na, K, Rb,
2. Close-packed molecular liquids : GEL,.^^ CCl,,Ql C,H,Cl,,g3 (C2H6)20,S8,.8
3. Associated molecular liquids : Hg0,93C ,H,,.0H.94
4. Nematic liquids.96
5. Smectic liquids : thallium st,earntr.SG
The precise intimate structure of liquids is still in dispute.
According to G. W. Stewart,g7 a liquid consists of a mass of small
quasi-crystallites, the so-called cybotactic groups , containing 10-
100 molecules, not necessarily permanent, and separated by a number
of unattached molecules. Another view contends that these
98
aggregates have only a statistical and not a physical existence, and
that every molecule in the liquid is immediately surrounded by the
same quasi-regular arrangement of molecules.
We have no space to discuss the great developments of the past
two years in the study of liquid crystals (see Ann. Reports, 1931, 28,
280). Luckily the whole subject is amply covered by the Faraday
Society’s volume Liquid Crystals and Anisotropic RTelts.”
“ 99
The most important facts that have emerged are the clear dis-
tinction between nematic liquids where neighbouriiig molecules are
merely oriented in parallel, and smectic liquids where they are also
arranged in regular planes, inside of which they either form a two-

line smectic), which are still free to move over each other. The
urious fo cal conic structures exhibited by smectic crystals have
been shown by (Sir) W. H. Bragg to be an equilibrium structure
for molecular layers lacking rigidity.
Glasses have plainly the same internal molecular structure as
liquids : they differb y their relative immobility, with the consequent
appearance of rigidity, or more correctly, of a long characteristic
time for plastic flow. (Liquids also have an internal rigidity, as
shown by B. V. Deriagin,2 but the characteristic time is short.)
Therniodyrmrnically, glasses differ from undercooled liquids by the
absence of internal equilibrium, as discussed by I?. Simon: E.
Berger,4 and G. Tarnm~~nn.T~h e liquid-glass transformation is not
sharp, but inside a small temperature range the slope of various
property-temperature curves changes markedly. Gels are diphasic
systems, one of which is generally a glass, though sometimes
crystalline .6
W. H. Zachnriasen7 has discussed the conditions under which
glasses are formed, equating them with the possibility of forming
three-dimensional frameworks. This, in the case of ionic glasses,
occurs when, in thc notation of p. 407, b/n 2 z/2, e.g., for boric
anhydride, silica, tungsten trioxide, beryllium fluoride. Glasses
may also be expected where metallic and homopolar structures have
approximately the same energy, e.g., for selenium and arsenic.
The actual atomic arrangements in vitreous silica have been
determined by B. Warren; it is simply a completely irregular
three-dimensional network of SiO, tetrahedra sharing oxygens.
Other glasses have also been studied by x-ray^.^
The utilisatjon of electronic and protonic waves for crystal, liquid,
and molecular analysis has grown into too large a subject to be
discussed in this report (see Ann. Reports, 1929, 26, 284). The main

1032 CRYSTALLINE PHASES
CRYSTALLINE PHASES OF SOME SUBSTANCES
STUDIED AS LIQUID CRYSTALS.
BY J. D. BERNALA ND D. CROWFOOT( Cambridge).
Received 29th March, 1933.
It is surprising, in view of the immense amount of labour expended
in the study of liquid crystals, how little attention has been paid to the
solid crystalline forms of the same substances. This omission, striking
enough in the days of classical crystallography, has become all the more
glaring now that it is known that even preliminary X-ray analysis of
molecular crystals can furnish details on the size and shape of molecules
and their mode of aggregation.
Up to the present, the only published work in this field has been
that of Kast on single crystals of para-azoxyanisole and K. Herrmann
and A. Krummacher2 on crystal powders, in the course of their ex-
tremely valuable X-ray investigation of X-ray diagrams of the
mesophases.
In the present work an attempt has been made to derive the crystal
structure of a few typical substances which give liquid crystals on
melting, and to correlate the data derived from the structure with the
optical appearances of the mesophases, and with observations on the
nature of mesoph ase transformations.
The crystals examined were chiefly supplied by K. Herrmann, by
V. Freedericksz and Zolina, and by A. S. C. Lawrence, to all of whom we
owe our cordial thanks for suggesting the attack on this fascinating
problem.

J. D. BERNAL AND D. CROWFOOT 1033
A fairly thorough X-ray study, with oscillation and Weissenberg
photographs has been made on the following crystals : (I) Para-
azoxyanisole ; (2) Para-azoxyphenetole ; (3) Anisal 1 : 5 Diaminonaph-
thalene ; (4) Cholesteryl chloride and bromide. A more qualitative exam-
ination has also been made on (5) Dibenzylidinebenzidine, (6) Ethyl-
anisal p-amino cinnamate, and on the metastable forms of (I) and (3).
In most of these cases the measurement of cell size and space group,
combined with the determination of the principal optic directions in the
crystal and the intensities of the chief X-ray reflections, have sufficed to
fix within fairly narrow limits the mutual positions and orientations of
the molecules. This was made easier by the discovery of a new pheno-
menon, characteristic of the crystals of substances which yield meso-
phases. On most X-ray photographs there appear, besides the sharp
points of crystal plane reflections, blurred lines-so-called smear lines ''
"
-which had already been observed in some minerals (mica, asbestos).
These lines correspond to a diffuse reflection in certain planes of the
reciprocal lattice, the normal to which in the crystal lies always parallel
to the molecular length along which there is a certain freedom of trans-
latory movement (see below). From this information the effective size
and shape of the molecules in the crystals of these substances can be
found, and the inference can be fairly made that this size and shape is
retained in its liquid crystal phases.
The detailed results are summarised below. Fuller crystallographic
data will be published elsewhere.

I. Para-azoxyanisole. CH,O~N=N--(I>-OCH,, stable
(yellow) form.
The crystallography of this substance has been described (Groth, V.,
p. 72) ; it occurs in monoclinic prisms along b, bounded by (101)a nd
(107). The cell dimensions are
,
a = 11-0 b = 8.10 c = 14-95 B = 107' 30'.
This cell contains four molecules. The reflections of (hol) are absent if
+
h I is odd, and of (olzo) when k is odd. As there is no evidence of
piezoelectricity the space group is Cih - P2,/n. There is no mole-
cular symmetry. The orientation of the molecules follows from the
optical properties. The refractive indices have been measured,"
y = 2.198, yellow with strong absorption, fi = 1.573, a = 1.564 practically
colourless and lie nearly _L to (001)a long b and 11 (001) respectively.
The length of the molecule is therefore nearly perpendicular to the
c face, and the almost uniaxial positive nature of the crystal points to
the planes of the rings in the same or different molecules being nearly
at right angles. The second hypothesis is accepted provisionally from
the analogy with the known structures of the azobenzene-stilbene group.*
It is possible to fit molecules of such orientation into the cell so as to
give a plausible structure accounting qualitatively for the chief X-ray
intensities. Such an arrangement is shown in Fig. I.
This interpretation is rendered more certain by the appearances of
smear lines," that is, the drawing out of spots on certain layer lines

perpendicular to this zone. This indicates unequivocally a structure in
which the x and y co-ordinates of the molecules are fixed, but where the
z co-ordinate is variable. In the case of the micas and asbestos where
similar smear lines are observed, the variability is due to variable chemical
constitution ; here it is almost certainly due to molecular translations
along the favoured c direction. These translations need not be active
ones due to heat motion, but may simply represent a statistical uncer-

tainty in the z co-ordinates of the molecule, due to an abnormal freedom
of motion parallel to the length of the molecule. Two points of interest
in the structure may be noted. The molecules do not lie in layers as in
most aliphatic and aromatic long molecular structures. Instead they
are imbricated, and in such a way that the ether group of one molecule
comes nearly in contact with the azoxy group of its neighbour. The
significance of this will be discussed below.

Attempts were made to take oscillation photographs of single crystals
of this form prepared from the melt by rapid cooling and with their
transformation delayed by cooling to 5" C. Although definite patterns
were obtained, they were not sufficient to establish the cell or space
group. The optical examination of the crystals and of their transforma-
tion to single crystals of the stable form suffices to show that they differ
remarkably little except in habit, being elongated along the direction
corresponding to [101] in the stable form, instead of along [OIO] and

The optical properties are those of a strongly positive nearly unia_xiaI
crystal with the principal axes y nearly parallel to the direction [IOZ].
As (402) and (202) are the strongest X-ray reflections, the axes of the
molecules almost certainly lie between [Toz]a nd [OOI]. This is sup-
ported by the smear lines which also correspond to the zone [~oz].A
structure built on these lines is shown in Fig. 2. (See footnote, p. 1035.)
As in para-azoxyanisol, the molecules are imbricated, and the ether
groups of one molecule lie next to the azoxy groups of the next.

these forms, but
as even in the minutest crystals there appeared in the course of exposure
crystals of one of the other forms, considerable caution is needed in the
interpretation of the photographs.
The following facts, though incomplete, are fairly well established.
The most direct basis of comparison are the reflections of the principal
plane b (010)i n the stable form. The spacings and orders of intensity of
this plane are shown below :
3a b = 12.7 A 010 abs. 020vs. 030 abs. 040 ms.
3b “ b ” = 11-4 010 ms. 020 abs. 030 s.
3c “ b ” = 13.1 OIO abs. 020 m. 030 abs. 040 vs.
In addition, there is a primitive translation in 3b of 9-25 A, not _L to
“b,” which indicates that b cannot here be a diad axis, and that the
crystal may indeed be triclinic.
It is noticeable that the two white forms, 3a and 36, resemble
“ ”
each other far more closely than either does the intermediate yellow 3b.
“ ”
The optical examination of the transformation indicates that both
transformations 3c + 3b, 3b + 3a and 3c + 3a, particularly the last, are
of a very slight nature as recrystallisation is regular, with only slight
change of optic directions, that of /3 remaining in all cases nearly per-
pendicular to the principal ‘‘ b plane. This indicates only a slight
”
degree of geometrical rearrangement of the molecules without loss of
parallelism. It is reasonable to assume that this will hold even in the
liquid crystal phase.

examination of the melt showed all the typical cholesteric structures,
including the beautiful iridescent colours. It is interesting to compare
these structures with those of the above substances, which only give
nematic mesophases.
The crystals are lath shaped monoclinic, elongated along b with only
the (001) face prominently developed.
The cell dimensions are
Chloride a = 10.3 b = 7.0 c = 21-2 fi = 131' a sin fl = 7-8
Bromide a = 10.7 b = 7-45 c = 21.4 fl = 132O a sin = 7.9

These are typical cholesteric dimensions,-compare the orthorhombic
dibromocholesteryl chloride a = 8.07, b = 7.7, c = 2 x zI,-with a flat

This, unlike the other substances examined, crystallised in the
typical thin flakes of a long molecule compound. The crystals were
extremely imperfect, and the X-ray data correspondingly doubtful. The
dimensions are probably correct, but the space group uncertain, and may
be only a pseudo-space group. The data are a = 5-9, b = 7.7, c sinP=z1.5
(main spacing) ; the /3 angle is uncertain, probably I 15', giving c = 23-8A ,
against a calculated molecular length of 20 A, which would allow 3-8 A for
end clearance. There are 2 molecules per cell, the space group is prob-

(fig).
The inclination of the molecules is probably with the long direc-
tion along t. The optical properties were a along b, 1t o (IOO),y along
c. The optic axial angle was small. This points to the planes of the
molecule being inclined to each other, much as in para-azoxyanisole, but
more nearly parallel to the (010) planes. In this case, also, the mole-
cules are in layers, and there is no imbrication.
6. Ethyl Anisal p-amino-cinnamate.
The crystals of this substance consisted of extremely thin mono-
clinic flakes somewhat elongated in the a direction and much twinned.
They were strongly optically positive with y nearly parallel to t and
a along b.
The cell dimensions were approximately
a = 6-65 b = 7.88 c = 45-6 B = 135" 35'
(oko) was absent with k odd and (hol) with I odd the space group is accord-
ingly a& - Pzl/c. There are four molecules per cell.
The most plausible explanation of this structure is that of a normal
long chain layer crystal. The molecules must lie nearly along the
c axis, therefore inclined at 45" to the c plane, the calculated molecular
length 20 A agreeing well with the half c axial length 22.8 A. The
molecules lie in two layers related by a glide plane gliding in the c
direction. This double layer differs from that of acids, alcohols and
salts in that in each layer there are molecules pointing in both directions
Dimensions and optical properties suggest that the planes of the rings
are not more than 35" from the b planes. The whole structure is typically
that of a substance with long molecules arranged in layers and contrasts
with the interleaved character of p-azoxyanisole.
It is regrettable that, for lack of suitable crystals, these were the only
X-ray examinations made of crystals yielding smectic mesophases. How-
ever, this defect is to a certain extent removed by our knowledge of the
optical properties of such crystals, suggesting similarities to those of
known structure, and by K. Herrmann and Krummacher's observa-
tions on powders. Both lead to the conclusion that all these crystals
are typical layer crystals of the aliphatic or aromatic long molecule
type, having single or double layers of parallel molecules. The transi-
tion from smectic to solid phase referred to below makes this almost
certain.
Optical Observations.

stances giving rise to mesophases is small unless it can be correlated to

some of the more striking properties of the mesophases themselves. This
might have been done by studying published work, but the observations
recorded were so various that it was considered worth while to make
fresh ones on the actual substances examined by X-rays.
For this purpose use was made of a hot wire apparatus originally
made for the production of single crystals of organic substances from
melts. Though plainly it must be used as complementary to the hot
stage apparatus, it has several advantages that the older method does
not possess.
The apparatus is ideally simple. It consists in a movable stage across
the central aperture of which is stretched a nichrome wire, which can
be heated by current from an accumulator.
The specimen is melted by a small flame between a microscope cover
glass and a splinter of cover glass about 10 mm. long, I mm. wide at
one end, and tapering to a needle point. When the specimen is placed
on the microscope stage under the heated wire, which is adjusted to
touch the top glass, there is a sharp temperature gradient which may
include 100' C. (more or less according to the temperature of the wire),
in the width of the field, and in which all the phases of the substance can
be simultaneously viewed in equilibrium. Transformations are observed,
not by heating the wire, but by moving the specimen very slowly, and
therefore heating one side and cooling the other. Metastable phases can
be induced by overheating one end of the specimen and then moving it
rapidly away from the wire, and in this way can be observed in equili-
brium with the melt. See Fig. .
By destroying all but one nucleus in the narrow end and crystallising -
slowly from that, it is possible to obtain large single crystals of stable or
metastable forms, and even large oriented plates, smectic or nematic.
Similar observation could be made in a wedge-shaped split mica
plate or on glass or crystalline surfaces without covers. The chief
advantage of the method is that different phases can be studied simul-
taneously, and their mutual relations far more easily determined than
by the ordinary method. Its chief disadvantage is that it gives no
exact temperature measurements, but rough measurements can be
obtained by calibrating the temperature gradient by observation of the
position of known transformation.
The following is a summary of the significant observations :-
(I) Para-azoxyaniso1e.-Observations of melts were made on glass
and mica. In both cases large oriented plates of the nematic phase were
found, showing all the well-known phenomena : singular lines, nuclei of
various sorts, etc., but it was noticed that these singularities arose either
from too rapid temperature change or from irregularities in the glass or
mica. Both the stable (yellow) and metastable (white) form could be
produced at will and, by arranging them on opposite sides of the hot
wire, the melting-point of the latter could be determined to be 84" C.,
using the melting-point of the former (94" C.) and of the nematic-liquid
SO'
transformation C.) as fixed points (see Plate I).
It was soon apparent that the metastable form was far more closely
related to the nematic than was the stable form. This showed particu-
larly well on mica. Here, both the nematic and metastable forms
tended to be oriented, the a axis of the latter making 40" to the b of
mica. Under these conditions, the optical properties of the metastable
form, and the nematic were extremely similar, only amounting to a
fraction of a fringe in birefringence, so that the crystal boundary was

often hard to distinguish. The conclusion is almost forced that, at the
melting-point, the molecules do not even change the gross nature of
packing or orientation but, remaining parallel, acquire a possibility of
transitional movement. The stable form, on the other hand, stands out
in marked contrast to the liquid. Both forms show the persistence of
the orienting pellicle on glass or mica after fusion, but the edge of this
is almost invisible in the case of the metastable crystals. The pellicle
can be observed to fuse below the nematic-liquid transition, but it is
interesting to note that under no circumstances have the pellicular
pseudo crystals been observed to grow.
(2) Para-azoxyphenetole behaves in most respects like para-azoxy-
anisole. Some specimens only, apparently contaminated with para-
azophenetole, showed a metastable form, and the stable form behaved
towards the liquid very much as did the stable form of para-
azoxyanisol.
(3) Anisal I :5 Diaminonaphtha1ine.-This substance, apart from its
higher melting-point, did not behave very differently from anisole or
phenetole. However, besides the white meta-metastable form, 3c, pre-
sumably corresponding to the nematic phase, and the yellow metastable
form, 3b, there is the white stable form, 3a, all of which could be observed
in equilibrium with the nematic phase. The interest of this substance
lies in the extreme width as well as length of its molecule, which suggests
the possibility that, unlike the para-azoxyanisole and phenetole, two
orientations in the molecule are fixed in the nematic phase. This is
supported by the crystal structure, and by Hermann’s observation that
the X-ray pattern of the nematic phase in a magnetic field shows two
halos of different spacing at right angles. It was, however, found im-
possible to obtain optical evidence for or against this hypothesis, as no
optic figure could be observed.
(4) Cholesteryl Chloride and Bromide.-These isomorphous bodies
were examined by the hot wire method. Both show cholesteric phases,
but these are metastable, or, more correctly, meta-metastable, and only
appear on cooling. There are stable and metastable crystalline forms,
both with melting-points higher than the cholesteric, so that neither can
be considered as corresponding to it in inner structure.
(5) Dibenzy1idenebenzidine.-This showed a typical nematic
mesophase, orientated perpendicular to the glass. The only unusual
observation is that drops of this solidifying showed typical layers of
Grandjean in the solid. This, and similar observations on mica, where
the nematic phase and the crystals show orientation, suggest that in
this case there may be a smectic phase, so isomorphous with the crystal
that no line of demarcation can be observed. If this is so, the
absence of cones shows that it must be of the SIo r solid smectic type
(see below).

Our observations are now completely in agreement with his. We had

previously failed to observe the transition I1 I11 which is only visible
as a slight alteration in the smectic phase for thicker preparations than

The metastable crystals I which grew slowly in the body of the
smectic phase I11 sometimes appeared to melt again into liquid crystal
111, but more often they transformed into the stable crystal I1 which
melted to the smectic liquid 11.
Between glass plates this had the usual cone structure while I was
homeotropic (see Plate 24). Between mica and glass large oriented
crystalline plates of both I, I1 and I11 could be obtained strictly
parallel and differing only in the greater bire"fringence of 11. Here I11
was indistinguishable. In a cleavage of mica the appearance is strikingly
different (see Plate 2b). At first sight there appear to be four phases
as before, the chief difference being that the second phase is oriented
perpendicular to the mica. Closer examination shows that this phase
is really double and that there are five in all

orienting power of mica being a function of the temperature, and here
again we would have two textures rather than two phases in the nematic

The following substances were also observed by the hot wire method,
although it was impossible to obtain large enough single crystals for
X-ray analysis. The object here was partly to elucidate K. Herrmann's
X-ray measurements and partly in an attempt to throw fresh light on
the controversy as to the simple or multiple nature of smectic and
nematic phases.

orientation except in case c where the molecules are parallel to the
glass. In this orientation its transition to I1 shows parallel orientation
but markedly lower birefringence. Phases I1 and 111, if, indeed, two
separate forms are present, showed all typically smectic characters ;
Grandjean planes with mobile edges, beaded drops, etc. IV on the other
hand is easily distinguishable by its darker colour and the formation of
facetted drops as well as by a highly viscous almost pasty consistency.
It seems to have no proper structure of its own and appears very different
if produced by heating from the stable crystalline phase or by cooling
from 111. In both cases the general appearance of the previous phase
is retained but the crystals appear cracked and the cones fixed in position
and with less definite outline. It can be cooled far below 145" C. but
at about 110" it transforms very sharply without a trace of under-
cooling to a metastable crystalline phase whose existence is not previously
recorded. This transformation can only be seen easily in orientations
perpendicular to the surface. Here the crystals appear as nearly uni-
axial and in a characteristic pattern of intersecting lines in six directions
30" apart. This pattern consists of three sets of interpenetrating twins
inclined at angles of 120'. Each set contains positive biaxial crystals

of small optic axial angle set growing along two directions at right angles
(see Plate 3).
The stable crystalline form appears in rhombic plates also nearly
uniaxial positive but with larger optic axial angle than the metastable.
These grow slowly in the metastable form at room temperature taking
several hours to replace it.
The chief interest in these observations is in respect to the nature of
phase IV. It is quite clearly different from phases I11 and from the
crystalline phases I and 11, but is it strictly a liquid crystal phase? It
is certainly not a smectic phase in the ordinary sense since K. Herrmann's
X-ray investigations gives not only a series of orders of reflection corre-
sponding to a long spacing of 24.2 A a number of other sharp lines corre-
sponding to spacings, 5-1,4 .62, 4-42 A etc., indicating further regularity
of structure. He interprets this as due to a new form in which the
molecules in the layers are arranged in a definite lattice but in which
these layers have no relation to each other. This would correspond to
one of C. Herrmann's theoretically possible intermediate states POPOR.
An alternative explanation is suggested by the hexagonal pattern of
the metastable crystals formed from phase IV. The sharp nature of
the transformation precludes serious molecular rearrangement and
suggests strongly that before breaking up the previously existing arrange-
ment was hexagonal.
The whole phenomenon is extraordinarily similar to that observed
by the author for Dodecyl alcohol where a definitely hexagonal form
due to rotating molecules was stable just below the freezing-point of the
liquid and broke up into plates of the monoclinic form, low temperature,
forming a similar pattern to that produced on cooling phase IV.
Phase IV may be in reality a rotating molecule crystalline phase of
this type. Such phases are highly deformable and difficult to distinguish
physically from liquids, while the hexagonal outlines observed in the
alcohol could not be formed as the phase cannot here originate from an
isotropic liquid.
This view may not ultimately be in conflict with that of K. Herrmann
as the hexagonal planes may be in motion, but further experimental
work is clearly needed here.

I11 and IV can be easily distinguished by the yellow colour of I11 while
IV and I1 show black between crossed nicols owing to homeotropy.

The other distinction is the appearance of the layers which are mobile
in 11, much multiplied but still mobile in I11 and acquire irregular outlines
in IV. The differences between IV, I11 and I1 always occur at the same
temperature, but there is no sharp optical boundary such as separates
I and 11. From Friedel’s point of view they might represent the same
phase with different textures. The chief difficulty is to explain the
yellow colour of I11 which would seem to indicate inclined molecules,
but this is in turn difficult to reconcile with the existence of layer drops.
The crystals were found to exist in two forms, one with high double re-
fraction which is metastable and one with small double refraction showing
an optic picture with small optic axial angle normal to the main plane.
The metastable crystals have a melting-point not more than a few
degrees below the stable form, and the rate of transformation is slow
especially on mica which seems to favour this modification. As before
while I1 can be accepted as a genuine smectic phase the explanation of
111 and IV offer the same difficulties as were discussed in the case of (6).
Here K. Herrmann’s results are peculiarly interesting. He finds sharp
side spacings in IV but not in 111, and the following main spacings, crystal
39A, IV and I11 32.8A.
Now the length of the molecule assumed nearly linear between
terminal carbons is approximately 33A which, allowing for an inter-
molecular -CH3, CH3- end clearance of 44, makes it appear very prob-
able that the molecules lie almost perpendicular to the planes in the
crystalline form and must certainly be inclined to them in states 111
and IV. A double layer inclined structure is extremely improbable
in the first instance owing to the nearly uniaxial character of the crystals,
while an inclined structure for 111 and IV is the more probable as shown
by K. Herrmann’s paper at the present meeting where he has established
its existence in the case of other smectic states.
Conclusions.
After an examination of such extremely complex phenomena, it is
worth while to attempt to bring together the contributions that X-ray
and crystal optical studies have to make on the constitution of liquid
crystals. This approach is essentially different from that based on
observations of properties such as viscosity, orientation, electric and
magnetic fields, in that it is concerned with the molecule itself and its
immediate neighbours rather than with cybotactic groups” or “swarms”
“
containing thousands of molecules. In other words it deals rather with
the structure than the texture of liquid crystals. The properties of
liquid crystals in the bulk are, so to speak, hydrodynamic (electro-mag-
net0 dynamic) consequences of the immediate forces between molecules.
Now these cannot be very different in the solid and in the liquid
crystal, as the gentle nature of the transformations between them shows.
The difference will not be in the state of the field surrounding the in-
dividual molecule, but in its possibility of transformation from one such
state to a similar one, and the height of the energy barrier then crossed,
in other words in the molecular degrees of freedom. C. Hermann
has given a complete treatment of the geometrically possible cases,
pointing out that at the time (apart from the true liquid (SSS) where
every translatory and rotatory movement is possible and the true
crystal {(RD)(RD)(RD)},w here none is) there were known the nematic
state (SSS) Cm, where only one rotational freedom remained, and the

smectic state (SSR) CCO,w here only two translations and one rotation
are possible. Since then, the work of K. Herrmann has demonstrated in
the S I forms of Diethylpuraxylylidenebisamino-cinnamatea nd Ethyl-
phenylbenzylamino-cinnamate,o ne or both of the types POPORor RD(R D)
where the sheets, but not individual molecules, have two degrees of
translatory freedom and possibly one of rotatory. Lastly, the present
work has indicated the possibility of RRD where the rows of molecules
have one degree of freedom. There remain the cholesteric phases of which
the precise form of association has yet to be discovered. If sufficient sub-
stances were examined, further Hermann types, such as RDS, would
probably be found.
Now, geometrically, there is nothing to prevent other than spherical
molecules from existing in any of these phases, and that they all do not
do so is no doubt due to the fact that their domains of stability are
included in each other, so that most of these phases would be metastable
and monotropic.
With these ideas in mind, we can enquire as to the nature of the
molecules required to form liquid crystals. The following conditions are
indicative for liquid crystals, though in our present state of knowledge
they cannot be considered necessary or sufficient.
I. We may accept to start with the classical postulate that the
molecule must be geometrically anisotropic, either rod-shaped, flat, or
lath-shaped. Optical (electric, magnetic) anisotropy is, of course,
fortuitous, and has nothing to do with the occurrence of liquid crystals,
though it profoundly affects their appearance and properties.
2. The molecule must not contain more than one active group
(active, that is, in producing intense local electric field) (hydroxy-,
carboxy-group) or the melting-point will be raised above the range of
stability of the liquid crystal phase. Molecules with only one active
group (e.g.,s oaps) can associate in pairs and thus simulate inactive mole-
cules.
3. Molecules should contain mildly active groups

\/-
otherwise the unspecific van der Waals’ attraction will lower the stability
range of the true liquid till it meets that of the crystal. Hydrocarbons
do not give good liquid crystals except in some cases for a degree or two
above the melting-point.6 If only one active group is present, or two
symmetrically, at the ends of molecules the tendency will be for crystals of
the platy, layer type (e.g., Ammonium oleate, ethyl para-azoxybenzoate)
which will give a smectic type of liquid crystals. Such crystals might be
called Smectogenic.” On the other hand, if molecules contain active
I‘
groups near the middle, as well as at the ends, this will lead to imbricated
crystal structures such as that of anisole or phenetole melting directly to
a nematic liquid. Such crystals showing marked smear lines in X-ray
photographs might be called Nematogenic.” It is noticeable that ethers
Lend to give nematogenic, esters smectogenic crystals.
4. The reason for the appearance of cholesteric properties is still
obscure, but we may hope for some advance now that the structure of
the chemical molecule has been elucidated.’ The most significant

property of these substances is their optically negative character. This
strongly suggests that here we have molecules which are either per-
pendicular to, or make a large angle with the axis of orientation of
the liquid crystals. This is what might be expected of the broad,
almost flat, sterol molecule. A geometrical consequence of this is,
however, the existence of planes perpendicular to this dimension
giving a formal resemblance to a smectic phase. Physically, it would
differ, however, owing to the fact that the molecules in each layer would
not be bound side by side nearly so well, and it consequently has a greater
fluidity than the true smectic phase. The small cone structure of choles-
teric substances strongly suggests the similarity to the smectic layer
structure distorted by surface forces. The most characteristic property
of cholesteric liquids, their optical activity, is probably structurally
irrelevant, but the optical colour properties, formally a consequence of
layer structures of the order of 500-5000 molecules thick, seem to be of
fundamental importance. From its scale, however, it seems not to be
paralleled by crystal lattice structure, but by the secondary coarser
structure of Tamman and Zwicky. It is therefore, in a strict sense, to
be interpreted macroscopically by some hydrodynamic theory.
It is probable that all the inner structures observed in mesophases
have their origin in surface forces. The effects of these are actually
simplest when the surface is that of a rigid foreign substance, glassor
mica. If there is free surface in contact with another phase the orienta-
tion of molecules inside this surface will be conditioned only by the
orientation of the surface layers. In nematic crystals, where there is
only orientation and no alignment, the case is simplest. The molecules
at the surface will everywhere lie parallel to it, and those in the interior
will have to accommodate themselves. In cases where the phase is
produced by the confluence of drops, parts of their common surfaces
become incorporated in the mass of the liquid. The whole of the
nematic phenomena of threads, nuclei of different orders, can be ex-
plained extremely simply on this view, but we have no space to go into
this question here.
In the case of smectic structures, it is probable that the focal cones,
rods, etc., are due to the instability of the plane molecular sheets, devoid
of any rigidity against the action of surface tension forces, which must
be widely different along and perpendicular to the sheets. The struc-
tures will be very different from the nematic, as there can here be no
yield by transference of molecules from one layer to another. The
smectic state is more influenced by surface forces than any other. In
the more fluid nematic and liquid these are limited in their action to a
thin layer by the fluidity of the interior ; in the solid, they are also limited
to a thick layer by the rigidity. Only in the smectic phase does the
action of surface forces permeate the whole body of the substance.
After the question of the occurrence and stability of mesophases, the
question of the nature of the transformations between them is of the
greatest interest. X-ray and optical observations have thrown consider-
able light on this problem. We may begin by drawing a new distinction
between two different modes, Homeomorphous and Morphotropic,"
" " "
of interphase transformations. The chief characters of these are shown
in the table.
We may call Homeomorphous any transformation between two
" "
phases of the same or different kinds (solid, liquid or mesophase) when
no change is made in the orientation and little in the mutual positions

of the molecules. Such a change is that occurring in the melting of solid
argon or copper (simple close-packed solid to close-packed liquid), of
that of metastable para-azoxyanisole to the nematic phase, or between
crystal I and liq. crystal I11 in (6) or (7). In this case, there is little
change in many of the properties, and we may correctly infer the
structure of the higher temperature phase from that of the lower.
In the second or Morphotropic type of transformation the mutual
" "
arrangement of the molecules is completely altered. Effectively there is
superposed on the normal increase in degrees of freedom on melting a
polymorphic transformation. This shows itself in abrupt change of
properties on melting, changes of volume and of refractive indices, by a

large latent heat, a relatively high melting-point and by a pronounced
tendency to undercooling. In this case the crystal growing in the melt
behaves much as if it were coming from solution. Such morphotropic
melts are shown by bismuth and ice for example, and in our case by
stable p-azoxyanisole and cholesteryl bromide. In cases of melting of
this sort we can only infer that the inner molecular constitution of the
liquid will be different from the solid and not as in the first what it
will be.
A solid will melt morphotropically when its molecular arrangement is
such that more than a slight change of mutual molecular position greatly
increases the potential energy. This will occur when the forces holding

the crystal together are due to local electropolar groups =0, OH,
COOH NH,, etc., particularly if these are well separated in space. In
the case of metalloidal substances, directed valencies fulfil this function.
In the extreme cases, the increase in energy on molecular displacement is
so great that no liquid at all is formed as in arsenic or quinone.
Ideally, every liquid has a homeomorphic crystalline phase of which
it is the disordered representation, while only certain crystals will have
a homeomorphic liquid. In actuality the homeomorphic crystalline
phase may often be metastable, monotropic and therefore difficult to
obtain or even not be physically realisable, either because before it is
reached the molecular movements become so sluggish that a glass results,
or when the liquid spontaneously transforms on cooling to another liquid
with a different form of molecular grouping. This change can happen
gradually, as in the case of water which as is shown in a later paper goes
over to an ice-like form, or sharp as in the case of several liquid crystal
transformations. Taking these possibilities into account, a scheme can
be drawn up showing the main types of transformation possible in solid
liquid and mesophases.
From this scheme it can be seen that the mesophases, far from being
an anomalous manifestation, take their place in a regular procession
from the disorder of the ideal liquid to the regularity of the ideal crystal.
In conclusion it is urged that the study of liquid crystals has reached
a stage when isolated research may often lead to more confusion than
knowledge, and we express the hope that some scheme of co-ordination
of the various methods of attack (optical, X-ray, magnetic, etc.) might
be reached at the present conference.
We owe our thanks to the Royal Society and to the Company of Gold-
smiths, through whose grants much of the apparatus used in the present
research was obtained.
