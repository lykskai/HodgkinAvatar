## Explanation of how the models work 

- The text model, TTS, and lipsyncing are all integrated within a single Colab notebook.
- The files used for this integration are stored in drive, which are the following:

  1. FAISS index for the RAG Database
  2. The text to speech output is stored in drive, and pulled from drive in the Colab code
  3. The video used for lip syncing is stored in drive
  4. The mp4 output is currently stored in drive as well.
